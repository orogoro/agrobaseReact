ACROBAT MZ 690 combines the locally systemic, translaminar properties of dimethomorph with the protective properties of mancozeb. ACROBAT MZ 690 should always be used as part of a protective spray programme and applied before disease symptoms appear. No cross-resistance with phenylamide resistant strains of fungi has been observed with ACROBAT MZ 690.

Dimethomorph acts by disrupting fungal cell wall growth, and is active at all stages in the fungal life cycle other than during the formation of zoospores and zoospore motility. Mancozeb is a protectant fungicide that provides a protective cover over plant surfaces, thus inhibiting spore germination.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EResistance Management\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EUnder high disease pressure, apply two close interval applications of ACROBAT MZ 690, followed by applications of either protectant fungicides or fungicides from another chemical group.

Betanal Forte is an effective post-emergence contact herbicide for the control of a wide variety of broad leaved weeds in beet crops. Betanal Forte readily controls seedling stages of: chickweed, fathen, fumitory, groundsel, redroot, shepherd\u0026rsquo;s purse, spurrey, nettle and twin cress. Black nightshade, cornbind and willow weed are controlled only up to four true leaf stage. \u0026nbsp;Grass weeds, mature annual broad-leaved weeds, perennial broadleaved weeds and wireweed are not controlled. \u0026nbsp;Small beet plants do not tolerate competition from weeds. You should aim, therefore, to establish\u0026nbsp; the crop quickly in a fine, firm seedbed and ensure weed competition is eliminated by applying a robust weed control programme.\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr \/\u003E Effective weed control during the first 8 - 10 weeks of the crop\u0027s life will maximise crop yields and returns.Betanal Forte effectively controls a wide range of broad-leaved weeds including willow weed, fathen, groundel, black nightshade in beet crops, providing increased yield and crop quality.Betanal Forte can be applied once the weeds have reached two true leaves ensuring weed competition is removed quickly.Betanal has a proud 40 year history of effective weed control and ongoing product innovation around the world.Betanal Forte contains 160 g\/L phenmedipham plus 160 g\/L desmedipham in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFODDER BEET\u003Cbr \/\u003E \u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeeds:\u003C\/strong\u003E Please refer to the label for a full list of the weeds controlled.\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr \/\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EUse:\u003C\/strong\u003E 1.5 L\/ha in 200 - 300 L of water after the crop has two leaves fully developed.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERED BEET, SUGAR BEET\u003Cbr \/\u003E \u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeeds:\u003C\/strong\u003E Please refer to the label for a full list of the weeds controlled.\u003Cbr \/\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EUse:\u003C\/strong\u003E 3.0 L in 200 L of water\/ha after the crop has two true leaves fully developed.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECritical Comments:\u003C\/strong\u003E For best results treat weeds at the youngest possible stage.

INFORMATION\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBuster is a proven, broad spectrum, non-selective contact herbicide providing post-emergent weed control of more than 60 common weeds found in New Zealand vineyards and orchards, including clovers, creeping mallow and willow herb.\u0026nbsp;To minimise the impact of weeds and to ensure best control, it is recommended that Buster is applied when weeds are small, during warm and moist growth conditions. Importantly, Buster has limited systemic movement and only affects what it directly hits. For this reason, Buster is safer than glyphosate based products, as accidental contact with desirable crops will not result in additional damage, other than to those areas directly contacted by the spray\/drift. Peace-of-mind from using New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s only \u0026lsquo;proven\u0026rsquo; glufosinate ammonium herbicide, Buster is highly effective against 60+ broad-leaved and grass weeds including clovers, creeping mallow and willow herb.

activity within the plant. Within hours of coming into direct contact or ingestion of CHESS WG Aphids and Whitefly cease to feed. Although they may still be present on the leaves a few days later, the Aphids and Whitefly are not causing any damage. CHESS WG is compatible with IPM programmes involving Phytoseiulus persimilis, Amblyseius fallacies and Encarsia spp and will not disrupt the activity of honey bees, although spraying should be avoided while bees are actively foraging.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERESISTANCE MANAGEMENT\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ECHESS WG belongs to a unique and new chemical class of insecticides with a novel mode of action. However, to minimise the risk of resistance, apply CHESS WG as recommended for the specific crop. If further control of the pest is required, use an insecticide with a different mode of action. The use of threshold monitoring and IPM programmes will allow optimum usage of the applications of CHESS WG. The removal of weeds from the crop and surrounding areas will assist in reducing the spread of plant viruses by aphids.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDIRECTIONS FOR USE\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIt is an offence to use this product on animals.\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELETTUCES\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPest:\u003C\/strong\u003E Lettuce Aphids\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERate:\u003C\/strong\u003E 400g \/ha\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECritical comments:\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/strong\u003EApply as a broadcast spray in sufficient water to give complete coverage without runoff.

control of Blackspot. CHORUS also has protective activity against Powdery Mildew and Dry Eye Rot (Botrytis spp) in apples and Blossom Blight (Monolinia spp) in apricots, peaches and nectarines. CHORUS rapidly enters the leaf and is rainfast within 2 hours of application. It is translaminar and can act curatively within 48 hours of a Blackspot infection (Mills period) occurring. CHORUS inhibits both penetration of the spore germ tube and mycelial growth within the leaf.

through the green parts of plants. The principal effect of CYCOCEL 750 is to inhibit cell elongation at the growing point of treated plants. Energy normally directed to the growing point is redirected causing modification to growth habit. Responses vary according to species, rate of use and timing. Timing is critical for optimum results.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWheat and Oats: CYCOCEL 750 stimulates root development, reduces stem length and causes the stem wall to thicken.

Height reduction may vary according to cultivar treated. Improved resistance to drought. Improved resistance to Eyespot damage.

with complementary modes of action delivering rapid knockdown and residual control of aphids. Lambda-cyhalothrin is a fast acting stomach and contact insecticide and pirimicarb a fast-acting contact insecticide which is partially systemic and has strong fumigant action. DOVETAIL is relatively stable to degradation in sunlight and hence gives extended control of insects on plant surfaces. It has short persistence in the soil. Thorough coverage of plants is important for optimum results.

Lack of soil moisture and the presence of raw organic matter will reduce or prevent pre-emergence activity. Post-emergence treatments are initially absorbed through the foliage and later via the root. Root absorption is also affected by moisture and organic matter. ETHOSAT is very selective in ryegrass spp. In pasture and in turf but will suppress clovers. Areas where clover production is important should not be treated with ETHOSAT as temporary suppression can be expected. ETHOSAT is also selective in Red Beet pre and post-emergence. Post-emergence treatment may cause some distortion to crop foliage particularly early in the season, but this does not adversely affect yield. Do not spray when rain is imminent or falling.

Extensive trials here and in Europe have shown that Firebird is safe to the crop. Firebird is applied pre-emergence of the weeds ensuring weed competition is eliminated for the important first weeks of the crop\u0027s life. Firebird controls competitive and difficult weeds such as vulpia hair grass, annual poa, field madder and field pansy. As Firebird is applied soon after planting it means that you can get on to the paddock to spray. You can then have the confidence to move on to other jobs knowing Firebird is protecting your crops from weeds.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHEAT, BARLEY\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeed:\u003C\/strong\u003E Pre-emergence weeds\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUse:\u003C\/strong\u003E Apply at 300 ml\/ha in a single application pre-emergence of the weeds and up to GS21 of autumn and winter sown crops sown no later than the end of June.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003C\/div\u003E","msds":"https:\/\/www.cropscience.bayer.co.nz\/~\/media\/internet\/BCSNZ\/CP\/CropScience%20NZ\/Product%20Downloads\/Herbicides\/Firebird\/Firebird%20SDS.ashx","label":"https:\/\/www.cropscience.bayer.co.nz\/~\/media\/internet\/BCSNZ\/CP\/CropScience%20NZ\/Product%20Downloads\/Herbicides\/Firebird\/Label%20Firebird%20P8095%20290113.ashx","registrationNumber":"P8095","slug":"firebird-1","activeMaterials":[{"id":1953,"amount":400,"amountUnit":"g\/l","activeMaterial":263},{"id":1954,"amount":200,"amountUnit":"g\/l","activeMaterial":244}],"cultures":[{"id":11875,"rateMin":300,"rateMax":300,"rateUnit":"ml","bbchMin":0,"bbchMax":0,"preharvestInterval":42,"culture":2},{"id":11876,"rateMin":300,"rateMax":300,"rateUnit":"ml","bbchMin":0,"bbchMax":0,"preharvestInterval":42,"culture":12},{"id":11877,"rateMin":300,"rateMax":300,"rateUnit":"ml","bbchMin":0,"bbchMax":0,"preharvestInterval":42,"culture":4},{"id":11878,"rateMin":300,"rateMax":300,"rateUnit":"ml","bbchMin":0,"bbchMax":0,"preharvestInterval":42,"culture":13}],"category":2,"manufacturer":2,"logo":null},{"id":33961,"name":"Firmus 500SC","registrationUntil":null,"description":"","msds":"","label":"","registrationNumber":"P8626","slug":"firmus-500sc","activeMaterials":[{"id":34361,"amount":500,"amountUnit":"g\/l","activeMaterial":215}],"cultures":[],"category":1,"manufacturer":323,"logo":null},{"id":38831,"name":"Firstrate 450","registrationUntil":null,"description":"","msds":"http:\/\/grosafe.co.nz\/media\/blfa_files\/safety_data_sheet_2.pdf","label":"https:\/\/eatsafe.nzfsa.govt.nz\/web\/public\/acvm-register?p_p_id=searchAcvm_WAR_aaol\u0026p_p_lifecycle=0\u0026p_p_state=exclusive\u0026p_p_mode=view\u0026p_p_col_id=column-2\u0026p_p_col_count=1\u0026_searchAcvm_WAR_aaol_action=document\u0026_searchAcvm_WAR_aaol_form-submit=true\u0026_searchAcvm_WAR_aaol_documentId=37338","registrationNumber":"P7336","slug":"firstrate-450","activeMaterials":[{"id":37602,"amount":450,"amountUnit":"g\/l","activeMaterial":279}],"cultures":[],"category":2,"manufacturer":361,"logo":null},{"id":42270,"name":"Flag FL","registrationUntil":null,"description":"","msds":"","label":"https:\/\/eatsafe.nzfsa.govt.nz\/web\/public\/acvm-register?p_p_id=searchAcvm_WAR_aaol\u0026p_p_lifecycle=0\u0026p_p_state=exclusive\u0026p_p_mode=view\u0026p_p_col_id=column-2\u0026p_p_col_count=1\u0026_searchAcvm_WAR_aaol_action=document\u0026_searchAcvm_WAR_aaol_form-submit=true\u0026_searchAcvm_WAR_aaol_documentId=29950","registrationNumber":"P5148","slug":"flag-fl","activeMaterials":[{"id":39187,"amount":430,"amountUnit":"g\/l","activeMaterial":218}],"cultures":[],"category":2,"manufacturer":47,"logo":null},{"id":8754,"name":"Flash","registrationUntil":null,"description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFLASH\u003C\/strong\u003E is a non-selective, non-residual, fast-acting contact herbicide active on green plant tissues only.

which is being made available in New Zealand for the 2014 spring planting season. It is ideal for using with Poncho and Gaucho treated seed and is a replacement for all other lubricants including talc and graphite. Trials in North America using Bayer Fluency Agent have shown that the amount of the active ingredient released as dust from treated seed during planting has been reduced by up to 65%. \u0026nbsp;By reducing dust contaminated by insecticide seed treatments, Bayer Fluency Agent reduces the risk of exposure to non-target insects, including bees. Bayer Fluency Agent was widely used across the U.S.A and Canada in the recent planting season with users rating the performance of the Bayer Fluency Agent equal to, or better than, other seed flow agents. \u0026nbsp;Results of the trials with Bayer Fluency Agent in New Zealand also showed performance equal to, or better than, the standard seed lubricants.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022grid__item one-whole lap-one-whole palm-one-whole\u0022\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022layout__tile RTE\u0022\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDIRECTIONS FOR USE:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EApply the recommended rate (see label) using the supplied measure. \u0026nbsp;Do not over apply as this can reduce efficacy.

Saves time and resources as you do not need to check your crops as often or to apply as many foliar insecticides to control the same target pests.

INFORMATION\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESave time and resources by controlling a wide range of common grass and broad-leaved weeds. Hussar is a proven herbicide providing broad spectrum, post-emergence control of a very wide range of common grass and broad-leaved weeds found in New Zealand cereal crops. Weeds compete very aggressively with your crop for nutrients, energy (in the form of light) and water and usually they win! The result: reduced yields, reduced grain quality, lower profits. To minimise the impact on crop yield, it is recommended that Hussar is applied when weeds are small, during warm and moist growth conditions. Hussar controls a wide range of broad leaved and grass weeds e.g. chickweed, cleavers, annual poa. \u0026nbsp;Hussar is particularly effective at controlling

DO NOT use all purpose spraying oil within 21 days before or after spraying CAPTAN. Use a non-ionic surfactant when a captan-based spraying program is in use in the orchard, as CAPTAN is not compatible with oil-based applications.

For optimum results apply during good growth conditions and when there is adequate soil moisture. Apply to annual grasses as seedlings and perennial grasses at the 4-5 leaf stage. Application during prolonged dry periods or cold conditions may reduce effectiveness. Always add a surfactant. LEOPARD Herbicide moves rapidly throughout all parts of the plant. Growth ceases almost immediately but symptoms of effect are slow to appear, with death taking up to 3-4 weeks to complete. LEOPARD Herbicide has a short residual life in the soil to control grass weeds germinating in the 2-3 week period following treatment.

For fungicide resistance management MAXIM 100 FS is a Group 12 fungicide. Some naturally occurring individual fungi resistant to MAXIM 100 FS and other Group 12 fungicides may exist through normal genetic variability in any fungal population. The resistant individuals can eventually dominate the fungi population if these fungicides are used repeatedly. These resistant fungi will not be controlled by MAXIM 100 FS and other Group 12 fungicides, thus resulting in a reduction in efficacy and possible yield loss. Since the occurrence of resistant fungi is difficult to detect prior to use, Syngenta Crop Protection Pty Limited accepts no liability for any losses that may result from the failure of MAXIM 100 FS

MCPA Amine 750 Herbicide is damaging to clovers. To minimise clover damage, especially where clovers are actively growing, hard graze to remove as much clover leaf as possible before spraying. Booklet MCPA Amine 750 Herbicide final label 11 Sep 2012 Page 7 of 8 HSNO classifications 6.1D, 6.9A, 8.3A, 9.1A, 9.1D, 9.2A, 9.3B Weeds are best controlled as small seedlings. Use the lower rate on seedlings and young plants, and the higher rate on larger weeds or during periods of hardened growth. Established perennial weeds may not be well controlled. Do not apply when crop or weeds are stressed. Weed control may be unsatisfactory where low soil temperatures inhibit plant growth. In established pastures spray weed seedlings in late autumn\/early winter, after clover growth has frosted. Spraying should be carried out in fine calm weather when weeds are dry. Rainfall within 2 hours may reduce efficacy.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWEEDS CONTROLLED \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/strong\u003EMCPA Amine 750 Herbicide controls or severely checks the following: Bathurst bur, black nightshade, burdock, buttercups (celery leaved, creeping*, giant*, and water), catsear, daisy, dandelion, fathen, field cress, fumitory, hawkbit, hedge mustard, hoary cress, mouse-eared hawksweed, nettles, Onehunga weed, oxtongue, pennycress, plantain, ragwort*, redroot, shepherd\u0026rsquo;s purse, storksbill, thistles (Californian*, nodding*, Scotch, sow, star, welted*, winged* and variegated), tiger weed (beggar\u0026rsquo;s ticks), twin cress, watercress*, wild turnip.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*Note \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/strong\u003ECalifornian thistle, creeping and giant buttercup, watercress \u0026ndash; Apply MCPA Amine 750 Herbicide at flower bud formation.

Add the required amount of MESOFLEX to the partly filled spray tank and top up with water. Keep mechanical agitator or bypass running while filling, during spraying and before recommencing spraying after a stoppage. Unused spray mixture will settle overnight.

translaminar insecticide with excellent efficacy, providing residual control against a range of sucking insect pests including mites, whiteflies and psyllids.Oberon provides a highly effective option for psyllid control in potato and outdoor tomato crops. Oberon provides proven control of potato psyllid, being highly effective against psyllid nymphs, while also reducing fecundity and viability of the eggs of adult females. Oberon provides a new mode of action classified as a Lipid Biosynthesis Inhibitor (LBI), that controls pests via ingestion and contact and is an ideal rotational partner.

nurseries, certain fruit crops, transplanted lettuce, onions, peas and in combination with atrazine and alachlor for the control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in maize. DO NOT USE ON SWEETCORN OR CROPS GROWN FOR SEED. Following application of Pendimethex Herbicide to the soils and its absorption by the plant, both root and shoot growth are inhibited in susceptible plants. Affected plants die shortly after germination or following emergence from the soil. Pendimethex Herbicide will not control perennial or established weeds. In maize a mixture of Pendimethex Herbicide and atrazine when applied early post emergence will also control broadleaf weeds up to the two true leaf stage and certain annual grass weeds up to 1 to 1 \u0026frac12; leaf stage. Weed control with Pendimethex Herbicide may be reduced where soil organic matter exceeds 6%. Approximately 12mm of rainfall or irrigation within ten days of application is required for optimum performance.

prothioconazole and tebuconazole, both very strong ear disease fungicides. A dual action approach results in very good control of late season disease.\u0026nbsp;Both prothioconazole and the partner strobilurin fungicide bring very important physiological benefits such as enhanced crop greening, and this coupled with long lasting disease control, means your crop will remain healthy and one to be proud of through the harvest. Prosaro is the ideal fungicide for wheat controlling all of the main diseases - Septoria leaf blotch, stripe rust, leaf rust and ear diseases.\u0026nbsp; Together with Aviator Xpro, Prosaro allows fungicide programmes to be devised for all wheat crops. Prosaro is an easy-to-use, ready mixed fungicide containing two different DMI fungicides. These are combined in the ideal ratio to help slow down the development of Septoria tritici intolerance to DMI fungicides.

For fungicide resistance management the product is both a Group 3 and a Group 11 fungicide. Some naturally occurring individual fungi resistant to RADIAL and other Group 3 and\/or Group 11 fungicides may exist through normal genetic variability in any fungal population. The resistant individuals can eventually dominate the fungal population if these fungicides are used repeatedly. These resistant fungi will not be controlled by this product and other Group 3 and\/or Group 11 fungicides, thus resulting in a reduction in efficacy and possible yield loss. Since the occurrence of resistant fungi is difficult to detect prior to use, ADAMA accepts no liability for any losses that may result from failure of RADIAL to control resistant fungi.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMIXING\u003C\/strong\u003E \u003Cbr \/\u003EHalf-fill the spray tank with clean water and start agitation.

Information\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESHARPEN is a novel herbicide for use in tank mix with knockdown herbicides such as glyphosate to enhance the speed of knockdown and to broaden the weed spectrum of the knockdown partner. Symptoms of herbicidal activity are visible soon after application with death ensuing in a few days. SHARPEN is systemic but thorough coverage of the target weed is necessary for best results. Best results are obtained from application to small, actively growing weeds. Conditions conducive to maximum photosynthesis (moist, warm, bright sunshine) are ideal. SHARPEN also assists in the rapid desiccation and reduction in palatability to stock of poisonous weeds such as ragwort.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESymptoms: SHARPEN is rapidly absorbed through the roots and foliage of plants. Within a few hours following application, the foliage of susceptible weeds shows signs of desiccation, and in subsequent days necrosis and death of the plant. Extremes in environmental conditions e.g. temperature and moisture, soil conditions and cultural practices may affect the activity of SHARPEN. Under warm moist conditions, herbicide symptoms may be accelerated. Under very dry conditions, the expression of herbicidal symptoms is delayed, and weeds hardened off by drought are less susceptible to SHARPEN.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWeeds controlled: When used in tank mixture with glyphosate SHARPEN increases the speed of knockdown of grasses such as annual poa and ryegrass; and broadleaved weeds such as dandelion, docks, clover, mallows, plantains and tall willow herb. When used in tank mixture with a residual grass herbicide in maize crops SHARPEN will control fathen, black nightshade, broadleaf docks (seedling), willow weed and wireweed, and will suppress pink shamrock.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EResistance Management\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESHARPEN contains a herbicide from the PPO (protoporphyrinogen-IX-oxidase) group, HRAC GROUP E HERBICIDE .

In non-agricultural areas the application of the higher rates will provide long term control of a wide range of weeds and grasses. Established perennial species are not always satisfactorily controlled. Since this product enters weeds mainly through their roots, its effectiveness depends on rainfall or irrigation after application to move it down into the weed root zone. Duration and effectiveness of the control depends on the amount of chemical applied, soil type, rainfall and particular weed species.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMIXING\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EInvert container several times before opening.

\/\u003ESphinx Fungicide is a morpholine fungicide, which has protectant and anti-sporulant activity against downy mildew on grapes, lettuce and onions, and late blight on potatoes. Dimethomorph, the active ingredient in Sphinx Fungicide, has a unique mode of action with systemic, penetrant and curative properties. Dimethomorph is systematically translocated upwards in the plant and is translaminar with local systemicity when applied to the foliage. Sphinx Fungicide should always be used as part of a protective spray programme and applied before disease symptoms appear. To prevent or delay the development of strains of disease fungi resistant to dimethomorph, it is recommended that this product be used in spray programmes including fungicides with different modes of action.

DO NOT USE ON SWEETCORN OR CROPS GROWN FOR SEED. Following application of STOMP XTRA to the soil and its absorption by the plant, both root and shoot growth are inhibited in susceptible plants. Affected plants die shortly after germination or following emergence from the soil. STOMP XTRA will not control perennial or established weeds. Weed control with STOMP XTRA may be reduced where soil organic matter exceeds 6%. Approximately 12 mm of rainfall or irrigation within ten days of application is required for optimum performance.

Ensure granules are evenly applied and completely covered with soil. When drilling ensure hoses from the insecticide box to the furrows are as straight as possible. Check regularly to ensure hoses have not blocked. Where the planter drill does not have a separate insecticide box, suSCon Green may be applied in mixture with the grass seed, or with the fertiliser. Mix thoroughly and evenly at the time of drilling. Ensure the drill is accurately calibrated to apply the correct rates of all components. Check regularly during drilling to ensure that granules remain mixed and have not settled out. A separate insecticide box is preferred when drilling suSCon Green with cereals because the large difference in seed and granule size makes the SuSCon Green prone to settling out and an uneven application may result. If suSCon Green must be mixed with cereal seed check often and maintain an even mix. The addition of bran may reduce separation however the drill must be correctly calibrated to ensure correct sowing rates. Use any mixtures within 7 days of mixing.

TERPAL is mainly taken up through the green parts of plants. TERPAL should only be applied to vigorously growing crops, which have an adequate supply of nutrient and moisture, and which are free from any stress prior to and following treatment. Optimum results are obtained when TERPAL is applied during the recommended stages of crop development. The main effect is to shorten and thicken the stem between internodes, on those parts that are undergoing stem elongation at, or following, treatment. Early treatment therefore provides the greatest protection against basal lodging, and later treatments are more effective at reducing straw and neck break. TERPAL is suited for application by ground or aerial spraying.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvantages of treatment\u003C\/strong\u003E: TERPAL improves the resistance of vigorous crops, to lodging. Yield losses associated with lodging, straw and neck break are reduced. Harvest is made easier. Fertiliser inputs can be aimed at optimum yields, rather than be limited, to avoid lodging.

TOPAS 200 EW penetrates rapidly into the leaf tissue, where it acts curatively on the developing fungal infections by inhibiting the creation of sterols in fungal cell walls. In apples, this action provides control of primary mildew infections and reduces both the infection of the fruit, which can occur soon after petal fall, and infected buds, which are a source of infection for the following season. In addition, TOPAS 200 EW in combination with a protectant fungicide, controls Blackspot by both a contact action on fungal spore germination and curatively within the leaf during the incubation period before symptoms appear.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERESISTANCE MANAGEMENT\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETOPAS 200 EW is a member of the demethylation inhibitor (DMI) group of fungicides. For fungicide resistance management TOPAS 200 EW is a Group 3 fungicide. Some naturally occurring individual fungi resistant to TOPAS 200 EW and other Group 3 fungicides may exist through normal genetic variability in any fungal population. The resistant individuals can eventually dominate the fungi population if these fungicides are used repeatedly.

It is inactivated immediately by soil particles and does not provide residual weed control.\u003Cbr \/\u003E - TOUCHDOWN IQ is translocated from treated vegetative growth to and into underground roots, rhizomes or stolons. Visible symptoms may take up to 14 days or even longer depending on growing conditions.\u003Cbr \/\u003E - Visible effects are a gradual wilting and yellowing of the foliage which advances to deterioration of both above and below ground parts.\u003Cbr \/\u003E - Delay application until the weeds are in the growth stage described in the \u0022Weeds Controlled\u0022 section of this label. Plants arising from unattached rhizomes or rootstocks of perennial weeds will not be affected by the spray and will continue to grow. For this reason best control of most perennial weeds is obtained at late growth stages approaching maturity.\u003Cbr \/\u003E - Ensure weeds are actively growing with sufficient leaf area to achieve optimum herbicide uptake.\u003Cbr \/\u003E - DO NOT treat weeds under poor growing conditions, when they are stressed, or if they are covered in dust or silt as reduced results may occur.\u003Cbr \/\u003E - Rainfall occurring up to 2 hours after application may reduce effectiveness.\u003Cbr \/\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EBEWARE: Apply this product carefully.

Trifluralin Herbicide controls weeds as they germinate, but will not control established weeds. The active ingredient of Trifluralin Herbicide is broken down by ultra violet light, so it must be incorporated into the soil immediately after application.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECROP SAFETY\u003C\/strong\u003E \u003Cbr \/\u003ETrifluralin Herbicide applied according to directions and under normal growing conditions will not harm the treated crop, however seedling disease, cold weather, deep planting, excessive moisture, high salt concentration, or drought may weaken crop seedlings and increase the possibility of crop damage. Under these conditions, delayed crop development, or reduced yields may result. Sowing linseed deeper than 3cm may result in some linseed stand reduction. Under prolonged dry conditions, or prolonged cold wet conditions, certain crops are susceptible to injury when planted in soil previously treated with Trifluralin Herbicide. To avoid such injury, it is not advisable to plant sensitive grasses, such as ryegrass or wheat, for 12 months following Trifluralin Herbicide application.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAPPLICATION AND INCORPORATION\u003C\/strong\u003E \u003Cbr \/\u003EThe soil should be flat, free of trash and large clods and not excessively wet. Foreign material such as plant residues or stones on or in the soil can reduce herbicide effectiveness. Trifluralin Herbicide should be evenly applied to the soil surface in a spray volume of 100-400 litres of water per hectare, at pressures of 200-300kPa. Avoid boom overlaps to minimise the risk of crop injury. Thorough incorporation is essential for weed control. Incorporation can be carried out as part of the normal seed bed preparation providing that the implements are used as per the following recommendations:\u003Cbr \/\u003E 1. Power driven rotary implements set to cut to depth of 5-10 cm. Lely Roterra may be used only if the spray boom is mounted on the implement. \u003Cbr \/\u003E2. Tandem discs set to cut 8-15cm deep and operated at a speed of not less than 6- 10kg\/h. \u003Cbr \/\u003E3. Heavy spike or diamond harrows or dutch harrows operated at 10-13km\/h. Trailing harrows must be weighted 20-30kg per section. Chain harrows are not recommended.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA minimum of two workings in different directions (ie at 90o to each other) is essential (except with rotary hoe) for thorough incorporation. The soil surface should be left relatively clod free, i.e. max. clod size 4cm diam. Shallow cultivation during the growth of the crop will not reduce weed control.\u0026nbsp;Soil organic matter warning: Do not use on soils with 9% or higher organic matter content, or peat type soils. Soil texture is given only as an indicator to organic matter level.
