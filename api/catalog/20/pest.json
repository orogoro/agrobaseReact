Grasses with runners, such as kikuyu and couch, and tufted perennial grasses, such as perennial rye and paspalum may be damaged. Adult beetles chew stemsjust below ground level, leaving frayed edges. Plants or tillers may fall over. Small larvae feed on decaying organic matter, changing to root feeding as they mature. Brown or dead patches result, and the grass is easily pulled out. The extent of damage to perenial grass pastures in Western Australia is unknown, but serious damage has been measured in New Zealand, where such pastures are widely grown. The incidence of African black beetle may increase if a trend towards perenial grasses develops in coastal regions. Adults occaisonally feed in the crown of cereal plants.

Newly hatched alfalfa weevil larvae are tiny and yellowish green with black heads. Older larvae also have black heads, but transition to more of a green color. Larvae have a distinct white line down the center of their backs and more subtle white lines along each side. Adult weevils are about a quarter inch (5-7 mm) long and light brown with a broad darker stripe extending down their midline.

These eggs will hatch in about 200-250 Fahrenheit degree days and newly hatched larvae will move to terminal leaves where they will feed causing small holes. Older larvae will feed on unfurled leaves and complete larval development takes about three weeks. Most mature larvae drop to the leaf litter and spin silken cocoons, emerging as adults in 7-10 days. Adults also feed on alfalfa, but do not appear to cause much damage.

Alfalfa weevil larvae defoliate plants and their feeding reduces yield, quality, and stand health. Weevil damage is typically concentrated on the first cutting of alfalfa (in most years, weevil larvae are out of fields by mid-June), but the impact of weevils on the first cutting can negatively influence vigor of the second cutting. Alfalfa weevil damage typically occurs as farmers are planting corn, so it can be easy to ignore. A density of one larva in thirty twelve-inch-tall plants has been estimated to reduce yield by about 3 lbs per acre. It is important to realize that the negative impact of alfalfa weevil on yield decreases with plant height; therefore, one larva in thirty sixteen-inch-tall plants translates to a loss of approximately 0.75 lb per acre.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"alfalfa-weevil","images":[{"id":39191,"image":"https:\/\/extension.entm.purdue.edu\/radicalbugs\/images\/pests\/adult\/alfalfaWeevilAdult.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/7\/70\/70c\/70c4c8cd-d5c4-4a28-9800-e4ad9e71fd0b.jpg"},{"id":39193,"image":"http:\/\/www.curci.de\/illustrated_catalogue\/curculionoidea-fauna_of_cyprus\/images\/habitus\/Hypera+jucunda.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/47\/474\/4746c100-48cd-410b-87e4-92ab02d2d47e.jpg"},{"id":39196,"image":"https:\/\/c2.staticflickr.com\/2\/1514\/24064166404_b6ac7903a7_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/fa\/fa9\/fa900b93-dd8b-4720-abf5-7b4cb7fecd2d.jpg"},{"id":39197,"image":"http:\/\/www.ahw.me\/p1\/hypera_postica04b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/1\/14\/14f\/14f62f1e-4c66-4b03-9575-2cc3b99b4631.jpg"},{"id":39198,"image":"https:\/\/c2.staticflickr.com\/2\/1462\/24457619962_93d613e161_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/1\/18\/18e\/18e90a97-51b6-4693-9209-690e49656acc.jpg"},{"id":39199,"image":"http:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/1236065.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/26\/26f\/26fd47b9-1ed4-4670-b774-20c11f1e4841.jpg"}]},{"id":1477,"name":"Angoumois grain moth","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Sitotroga cerealella","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003EThe adult is a small buff to yellowish-brown moth about one-third inch long with a wing span of one-half inch.

After larvae complete development inside tightly curled leaves, some may pupate in the rolled leaves but most drop to the ground to pupate in leaf litter or just below the soil surface. Pupae are surrounded by tough, silken cocoons. In the Northwest, two or three generations are produced each season, although suspected overlapping of generations has been reported and timing of generations has been little studied.

All reports in the literature specify one generation per year. The information from the Pacific Northwest is scarce, thus much of the information is taken from other areas. The apple mealybug overwinters as a second instar nymph in a cocoon under bark scales or in cracks in the bark. Feeding is done by inserting the proboscis into plant tissues (bark or leaves) and sucking plant sap. They emerge from overwintering sites very early in the spring, feed on twigs, mature to the adult stage (male and female) and mate. Egglaying begins in early May in central Washington.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe mealybugs appear to be quite indiscriminate about their oviposition sites; many of the nests are on twigs, especially in the crotches; some are in pruning scars on heavy wood, and some are on the leaves (underside is common, but they can also be found on the upper surface). In heavy infestations, nests can be found on twine used for tree training, or dead leaves. Multiple nests are frequently laid overlapping each other, especially in the crotches of twigs. Just before laying her eggs, the female becomes sedentary, and develops a loose, fluffy covering of waxy filaments. Eggs are laid, and the ovisac constructed as she moves along. The female may construct more than one ovisac, but most frequently, the female can be found at one end of the ovisac, where she eventually dies. Initially the female in the nest will retain the sage green color, but becomes progressively more yellow as she begins to dessicate. Eggs begin to hatch in early June, although crawlers may not emerge from the nests immediately. Gradually, they disperse to nearby tissues (leaves, especially near the midribs; twigs; leaf axils, and fruit) and begin feeding. Nymphs grow slowly over the course of the summer, and partially grown nymphs seek overwintering quarters in the fall.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"apple-mealybug","images":[{"id":36682,"image":"http:\/\/www.bnhs.co.uk\/focuson\/scales\/images\/Phenacoccus%20aceris%20a1.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/46\/467\/46704b49-6a64-4b6b-a151-df44fc68ebfe.jpg"},{"id":36683,"image":"http:\/\/img-fotki.yandex.ru\/get\/9227\/20291100.29\/0_b385c_8f566504_XL.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/93\/939\/939f54c1-43fd-406d-844c-39fb5cd248ba.jpg"},{"id":36686,"image":"http:\/\/www.bnhs.co.uk\/focuson\/scales\/images\/Pseudochermes%20fraxini%20b1.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/5\/5e\/5e4\/5e413fcc-27dc-4083-a84f-72655de08304.jpg"},{"id":58281,"image":"http:\/\/entomofaune.qc.ca\/entomofaune\/cochenilles\/liste\/120606_d_028.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/5\/59\/590\/5908d939-68b5-4527-b506-edf93866f8f6.jpg"},{"id":58282,"image":"http:\/\/www.sad24.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/IMG_3026.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/20\/20a\/20aed0a5-fdf0-4958-af99-d083eef1653a.jpg"}]},{"id":5265,"name":"Apple rust mite","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Aculus schlechtendali","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHosts\u003C\/strong\u003E.\u0026nbsp;The apple rust mite attacks cultivated apple and several other species in the genus Malus.

The moth has five color forms, ranging from a lighter form with fairly distinct wing markings to a darker melanic form with less distinct wing markings. Female army cutworm moths lay their eggs directly onto soil. They seem to be attracted to bare areas such as overgrazed pastures, alfalfa stubble, stressed grassy areas, and newly planted or tilled cropland. Females lay from 1,000 to 3,000 eggs from late August until late October. The result of this extended ovipositional period is a great variation in larval size within fields.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe eggs hatch shortly after they have been exposed to moisture (i.e. rainfall). Larvae continue to feed as long as temperatures are favorable, and partially grown larvae overwinter in the soil. Larval feeding activity resumes in late winter or early spring when soil temperatures increase. Army cutworms become active at relatively cool temperatures, possibly even below 40 F, because solar heating warms soil temperatures well above the air temperature. Feeding continues through the spring. Fully grown larvae burrow into the soil, create an earthen chamber, and pupate. Adults emerge from the soil in May and early June to complete the life cycle. Generally, larvae of the army cutworm have a pale grayish body color that is splotched with variable white or light markings. The upper surface is lighter with a pale stripe along the center of the back. There is a lighter band along the side of the larvae below the spiracles. Larvae can attain lengths of 1 1\/2 to 2 inches when fully grown.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe most prominent trait of the army cutworm moth is its migration pattern. Adults emerge in May and early June and feed on a variety of nectar-bearing flowering plants. These moths gradually migrate westward toward the mountains and continue to feed on available nectar sources as they ascend in elevation. As they move westward, they rest during the day in dense vegetation or seek shelter in garages, attics and living areas of houses, and can become a significant nuisance pest at this time. During outbreak years, tremendous numbers of these moths can congregate around buildings and residential areas. Moths may remain in these areas for several days, feeding on local nectar sources. However, when temperatures begin to warm consistently and flowering of major plants in the area has ceased, the moths will move westward to higher elevations offering cooler temperatures and new sources of food. The moths spend the summer in the Rocky Mountains, and in late August and September they return to the plains to mate and deposit eggs.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"army-cutworm","images":[{"id":39367,"image":"http:\/\/amazingnature.us\/moths\/euxoa1cd.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/c2\/c2e\/c2e711a6-5768-4881-b1c8-15a9417e0258.jpg"},{"id":39369,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/3d\/Euxoa_auxiliaris_caterpillar.jpg\/1024px-Euxoa_auxiliaris_caterpillar.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/a\/a3\/a3a\/a3a2e286-43b1-4c1f-9551-601a5d405f8f.jpg"},{"id":39371,"image":"http:\/\/m9.i.pbase.com\/o9\/86\/545286\/1\/157694149.YICFZvBT.Untitled25.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/be\/bea\/bea76930-da64-4cdc-ad79-f38664103728.jpg"},{"id":39373,"image":"http:\/\/m7.i.pbase.com\/o9\/86\/545286\/1\/111738987.DyS0k6PK.MD04240921pb.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/f2\/f29\/f29973a1-1321-4207-8395-78de89c1f36f.jpg"},{"id":71714,"image":"http:\/\/mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu\/Files1\/GA\/300\/GA10731b-300.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/ec\/ec9\/ec9de169-7500-493d-9ec8-32673eaad7fa.jpg"}]},{"id":4858,"name":"Asparagus beetle","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Crioceris asparagi","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe common asparagus beetle (\u003Cem\u003ECrioceris asparagi\u003C\/em\u003E) is the most\u0026nbsp;prevalent asparagus pest that damages young asparagus spears.

The western spotted and the western striped cucumber beetles occur throughout California and are major pests of cucurbits; the banded cucumber beetle occurs primarily in southern California. Cucumber beetles overwinter as adults and are active by the time the earliest melons are planted in spring. Adults lay eggs at the base of plants. As soon as they hatch, larvae begin to feed on plant roots. They complete their development in the soil. There are about three generations a year. Cucumber beetles are about 0.36 inch (9 mm) long and either have a greenish yellow background with black spots or alternating black and yellow stripes. They fly readily and migrate into cultivated areas from alfalfa and other crops, and from uncultivated lands. Cucumber beetles like moisture and dislike heat; consequently, melon fields are especially attractive in hot weather during and after an irrigation. Western striped cucumber beetle larvae feed exclusively on cucurbit roots, whereas western spotted cucumber beetle larvae feed on a wide variety of plants including grasses, corn, legumes, and cucurbits. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. Cucumber beetles are serious pests of smooth-skinned cucurbits, especially melon varieties such as honeydew, crenshaw, and casaba. While the adults prefer tender, succulent portions of plants, including the flowers and leaves, which they may destroy with their feeding, it is the damage to the surface of the melon that reduces marketable yield. When temperatures are high, adults especially feed on the undersides of young melons, scarring them. After the skin hardens, melons are much less subject to attack. Scarring in the crown of the plant is also typical of adult damage. Feeding on stems of young plants, followed by sustained winds, may result in severe stand reductions making replanting necessary. In some situations, larvae may cause serious injury by feeding on roots, and young plants can be killed. Cucumber beetles also spread squash mosaic virus.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"banded-cucumber-beetle","images":[{"id":37599,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/cf\/Diabrotica_balteata.jpg\/640px-Diabrotica_balteata.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/06\/063\/06310c8e-3856-4a5e-abd8-0ce049d0e9fb.jpg"},{"id":37601,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/28\/Diabrotica_balteata_3.jpg\/1024px-Diabrotica_balteata_3.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/40\/402\/40298224-5c4a-4484-b366-12ef72833805.jpg"},{"id":37602,"image":"http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/beetles\/diabrotica\/images\/fs_images\/D_sallei_PLT_Paris_hab_dors.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/95\/955\/955c21aa-a8f5-46e1-9f83-c7bd7e18da19.jpg"},{"id":37603,"image":"http:\/\/www.invasive.org\/images\/768x512\/1233189.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/9b\/9b9\/9b953cb0-c41a-465a-ab7a-438bd858d5e4.jpg"},{"id":37605,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/11\/Diabrotica_balteata_4.jpg\/1024px-Diabrotica_balteata_4.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/5\/57\/574\/5742ada2-4339-4071-919e-6b0ea5f092c3.jpg"},{"id":37607,"image":"http:\/\/static.inaturalist.org\/photos\/2912010\/original.jpg?1453446582","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/93\/939\/93951ce9-80e6-4233-9ecc-c0552961577d.jpg"}]},{"id":5223,"name":"Banded sunflower moth","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Cochylis hospes","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription\u003C\/strong\u003E: The adult has a dark band across the buff or yellowish-tan forewings.

Bertha armyworm overwinters as a pupa in the soil. Adults emerge in mid-Spring, and the females lay eggs in masses on the underside of leaves of crop plants and weeds (particularly lambsquarters). Eggs hatch in 4 to 8 days. Larvae dangle from the plant by threads of silk until they reach other leaves or are blown by the wind to other plants, where they begin feeding. Thus infestations of bertha armyworm tend to occur in patches fairly close to where the eggs were deposited. Sometimes the larvae will remain on a single plant where they were laid. Larvae feed for 5 to 6 weeks in June and July. In their late stages (fifth and sixth instar) the larvae disperse. This is why they call them \u0026ldquo;armyworms\u0026rdquo;.

Black cutworm has three generation per year. It is a somewhat sporadic pest because it is mostly migratory with few individuals surviving the winter in northern states like Pennsylvania. It should be noted however that there are anecdotal accounts of overwintering moths as far north as Delaware. Most black cutworms spend the winter as pupae or adults along the Gulf Coast and migrate northward on leading edges of cold fronts. This annual migration begins in February, but is heaviest in April and May. Adult female moths of this first and most-damaging generation lay eggs singly or in masses (as many as 30) on grasses, dense patches of weeds, and debris. Eggs are often laid prior to crops being planted. Black cutworm has a minimum developmental threshold of 50 F and degree-day accumulation can be used to predict larval damage. Degree-day accumulation begins when pheromone traps detect a significant flight of moths (typically 9 males over 2 nights), then cutting activity tends to occur after about 300 Fahrenheit degree days, and pupation occurs after about 640 degree days. Moths of the second and third generations are active in July and early autumn, respectively, with individuals of the final generation flying south to escape dropping temperatures.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. Black cutworms exhibit two types of feeding patterns depending upon the amount of moisture in the soil and size of plants. Where soil moisture is adequate and plants are small, the larvae hide in the soil during the day and move to the soil surface at night where they cut off plants just above the soil surface. This is typical damage for most cutworm species. One larva will cut off an average of five corn plants during its development. In situations of dry soil conditions, the larvae do not move to the surface to feed, but instead, they chew into the plant just below the soil surface. This causes the corn plants to wilt and usually die. Loss of plants in infested fields will vary from 10 to 80 percent.

Most eggs hatch over a 2 to 3 week period in the spring. \u003Cbr \/\u003EIn New Brunswick, larvae (the grub stage) begin feeding on the leaves and buds before they are fully expanded. In southern NB, larval populations have been collected starting from mid-May. Peak populations occur from late May until mid to late-June, then gradually decline. In northern NB, peak larval populations occur from late May to late June, then gradually decline. The larva goes through three instars (stages), with the largest instar being approximately 6 mm long. The larval stage lasts from 10 to 19 days, depending upon the temperature. The larva is dark brown to almost black in colour. It is similar in appearance to that of the blueberry leaf beetle larva which is lighter brown (and much less common). Six legs can be seen under the body behind the head. The full-grown larva crawls into the leaf litter to transform into a pupa to become an adult. The development period for a mature larva to become an adult is 15 to 28 days (average 17 days).\u0026nbsp;The pupa can occur 12 mm into the soil.

In northern NB, adults have been collected from just before mid-July until autumn, with peak populations occurring from mid-July until early September. Newly emerged adults mate after approximately 10 to 14 days. Eggs are laid a few days later. This would indicate that the majority of eggs are laid from mid-July to late August in southern NB and from late-July to late-August in northern NB.

A walnut leaf is what is called a compound leaf. It has six paired leaflets opposite each other on each side of a stem-like structure called a rachis. Together, they make up the leaf. When the fallen leaf was examined, the only damage was to the end of the rachis where it was attached to the twig. The rachis end or petiole was brown and broken apart and a hole and tunnel were visible.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe adults spend the winter under leaves and plants around the trees. They feed on new leaf growth and their first eggs are laid on the stems of the new leaves in the early spring. Later, they lay eggs in crescent-shaped scars made on the developing new nuts. When the eggs hatch, the larvae tunnel into the stems and begin to feed. The rachis looks healthy, but is being damaged inside.\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn four or five weeks when the larvae grow as big as they are going to get, tunnel out of the rachis and leave an exit hole. They then burrow into the soil under the tree to pupate to become an adult. The new adults emerge from the soil in late summer and feed on leaf petioles, shoots and terminal ends of twigs until cold weather forces them off the tree and into the leaf litter and collapsed plants. The cycle is complete and spring-loaded for the next growing season.\u003Cbr \/\u003EInsect populations are like waves on the ocean; they rise and fall. This was a very big year for butternut curculio. It is often difficult to determine why populations vary, but it usually has to do with winter or summer weather conditions, predators or diseases. The only thing that is certain is that next spring the butternut curculio population will be different.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThere is no treatment for butternut curculio.

Egg hatch may begin in mid- to late May. After hatching, the larval stage passes through five or six instars, and then it pupates. To prepare for pupation, mature larvae spin coarse, netlike cocoons of silken threads, often on partially defoliated leaves. In severely defoliated stands, cocoons may be spun on exposed branch tips, in bark crevices, or stumps in the undergrowth. The pupal period varies from 9 to 17 days. Adults emerge in late June through July. They are on the wing at night.

European apple sawfly overwinters as a mature larva in a cocoon a few centimetres below the soil surface. The larva pupates in the spring and adults emerge during the pink stage of apples. The female European apple sawfly lays eggs just after the king flower opens. Eggs are deposited singly at the calyx end of the flower, often at the base of or between the stamens. After 8-10 days, newly hatched larva burrow into the apple and feed on tissue just below the skin. As the larva matures, it tunnels deeper into the seed cavity and feeds on one or two seeds. Larva often move between developing fruitlets. Larva matures in four to six weeks, then leave the fruit (which has usually dropped), burrow into the soil and form a cocoon in preparation for pupation. There is one generation per year. Diapause may last for up to three years.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. First instar larvae feed beneath the fruit skin and create a heavily russeted, winding, ribbon-like scar that spirals out from the calyx end. If larva ceases feeding at this early stage, for whatever reason, this damage will likely be seen on mature fruit at harvest. If this tunneling stops early, tunneling scars are short and indistinguishable from damage caused by the tarnished plant bug.\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr \/\u003ESecond instar larvae tunnel into fruit towards the seed cavity. Reddish-brown frass is often seen protruding from an exit hole in fruit. Larval feeding into the core of the apple often causes fruit to abort, while sub-surface feeding creates scars visible on the fruit at harvest.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs the larva molts and matures, it moves towards the seed cavity or adjacent fruit. As the larva feeds internally, it enlarges its exit hole with wet, reddish-brown frass on the side of the fruit. The larva moves to other fruit in the cluster to continue feeding. A single larva can damage several apples. Damaged fruit drops during the \u0022June drop\u0022 period. In insecticide-free apple orchards in Quebec, approximately 4% of the apple crop in affected orchards can be damaged by European apple sawfly.\u003Cbr \/\u003EInjury from secondary feeding causes fruit to drop. Secondary injury by European apple sawfly can be confused with codling moth damage. There are three ways to distinguish these two pests.\u003Cbr \/\u003E1.

They fly on warm evenings (above 65 degrees F) for several hours just before and after sunset. Adult activity peaks within two to three weeks of first emergence. Eggs are deposited 2 to 4 inches below the soil surface. First instar (or larval stage) grubs emerge from eggs in early August and molt to second larval instar by the middle of August.

The eyespotted budmoth has only one generation per year. It overwinters as a partially grown larva within a hibernaculum in crotches of small diameter wood. Larvae become active in spring as buds begin to show green tissue. The young larva first burrows into a bud, feeding on the leaf and flower parts. Later in the spring, the larva forms a tubular feeding nest by webbing together several leaves and flower parts of a spur or growing tip. The nest may contain one or more dying or dead leaves produced by the larva partially severing the petioles of leaves in the cluster. The first larvae are full grown by late May or early June. When mature, they pupate within the feeding nest. The pupal stage lasts 10 to 15 days. Adults begin to emerge in mid- to late June, with the flight continuing into July. Eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower surfaces of leaves, and incubation takes 7 to 14 days. Larvae begin feeding on lower leaf surfaces, constructing feeding sites near the midribs. The sites are covered by silken webs strewn with frass. Leaves touching one another or a leaf touching an apple are also desirable feeding sites. Development continues until larvae are half grown, usually by late July or early August, when they leave feeding sites and construct hibernacula. The larvae incorporate bits of frass and plant parts into the hibernacula so that after some weathering they appear similar to the bark and are inconspicuous.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. Feeding by larvae on buds and blossoms in early spring is not a problem unless populations are very high. Boring of larvae into growing shoots can be serious in young trees or nursery stock where it results in restricted growth or abnormal tree form. Larval feeding on fruit is most important. Feeding on fruit by mature larvae just after bloom results in damage similar to that caused by early season leafroller feeding. Feeding on fruit by young larvae in mid- to late summer results in a cluster of tiny, circular excavations in the fruit. These excavations are not deep and are usually separated from each other. They can look very similar to damage caused by young leafroller larvae in midsummer.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"eyespotted-budmoth","images":[{"id":37805,"image":"http:\/\/britishlepidoptera.weebly.com\/uploads\/5\/9\/8\/4\/5984437\/2685141_orig.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/e2\/e2f\/e2f1be84-395b-49ad-820b-d2f385a97d49.jpg"},{"id":37806,"image":"http:\/\/www.ukmoths.org.uk\/site\/assets\/files\/11342\/1205s_ocellanabs.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/c1\/c15\/c15bb9e0-283f-4cf2-bddf-0ff53eec9285.jpg"},{"id":37807,"image":"http:\/\/britishlepidoptera.weebly.com\/uploads\/5\/9\/8\/4\/5984437\/482899_orig.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/e8\/e86\/e8689f7f-e6c9-4879-85a0-97d1e1d8386c.jpg"},{"id":37810,"image":"http:\/\/www.lepiforum.de\/webbbs\/media\/forum_2_2013\/16\/16900_2.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/f9\/f94\/f9496e09-f3b1-44d9-9b10-03e247b43882.jpg"},{"id":37811,"image":"http:\/\/britishlepidoptera.weebly.com\/uploads\/5\/9\/8\/4\/5984437\/2426501_orig.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/6\/65\/657\/6575a4de-09c7-4c4c-853c-af0c712783a4.jpg"},{"id":37814,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/cd\/(1205)_Spilonota_ocellana_(19418859938).jpg\/950px-(1205)_Spilonota_ocellana_(19418859938).jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/84\/848\/848d22de-c284-459b-8c8d-f79923ddfb3f.jpg"}]},{"id":4425,"name":"Fall Armyworm","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Spodoptera frugiperda","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe fall armyworm moth has dark gray, mottled forewings with light and dark splotches, and a noticeable white spot near the extreme end of each.

Adult fungus gnats may emerge from houseplants indoors and become a nuisance.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIDENTIFICATION\u003C\/strong\u003E.

Adult fungus gnats have slender legs with segmented antennae that are longer than their head. Their long antennae distinguish them from the more robust shore flies, which are also found in greenhouses, associated with algae and decomposing organic matter, but have short bristle-like antennae. Although a few species are up to 1\u0026frasl;2 inch long, fungus gnat adults commonly are about 1\u0026frasl;16 to 1\u0026frasl;8 inch long.

However, in comparison with more active species such as the common housefly (\u003Cem\u003EMusca domestica\u003C\/em\u003E), fungus gnats are relatively weak fliers and usually don\u0026rsquo;t move around much indoors.

Larvae have a shiny black head and an elongated, whitish-to-clear, legless body. They eat organic mulch, leaf mold, grass clippings, compost, root hairs, and fungi. If conditions are especially moist and fungus gnats are abundant, larvae can leave slime trails on the surface of media that look like trails from small snails or slugs.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDAMAGE\u003C\/strong\u003E. Adult fungus gnats don\u0026rsquo;t damage plants or bite people; their presence is primarily considered a nuisance. Larvae, however, when present in large numbers, can damage roots and stunt plant growth, particularly in seedlings and young plants. Significant root damage and even plant death have been observed in interior plantscapes and in houseplants when high populations were associated with moist, organically-rich soil. Thus, a houseplant that is wilting may not indicate a lack of water, but rather root damage by fungus gnat larvae or (more commonly) other causes of unhealthy roots. However, too much or too little water, root decay fungi, and improper soil conditions (e.g., poor drainage, or waterlogging) are much more common causes of wilted plants.\u003Cbr \/\u003ESerious fungus gnat damage is more common in greenhouses, nurseries, and sod farms. Although larvae also feed on plant roots outdoors, they don\u0026rsquo;t usually cause serious damage.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELIFE CYCLE\u003C\/strong\u003E. Fungus gnats develop through four stages\u0026mdash;egg, larva (with four larval stages or instars), pupa, and adult. The tiny eggs and oblong pupae occur in damp organic media where females lay eggs and larvae feed. At 75 F, eggs hatch in about 3 days, the larvae take approximately 10 days to develop into pupae, and about 4 days later the adults emerge. A generation of fungus gnats (from female to female) can be produced in about 17 days depending upon temperature. The warmer it is, the faster they will develop and the more generations will be produced in a year.\u003Cbr \/\u003EFungus gnats have many overlapping generations each year. Outdoors, they are most common during winter and spring in interior areas of California, when water is more available and cooler temperatures prevail. They can occur during any time of the year in moist coastal regions and indoors.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"fungus-gnats","images":[{"id":8391,"image":"http:\/\/images.slideplayer.com\/19\/5811255\/slides\/slide_8.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/30\/30a\/30a5eb61-27e6-4611-a9ab-32b8944e3250.jpg"},{"id":56159,"image":"https:\/\/farm1.staticflickr.com\/697\/31532099546_e4f1bf0734_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/e1\/e12\/e1282c3f-d3d2-4f4c-a18e-a218317270ac.jpg"},{"id":56160,"image":"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3180\/3008586728_08705388e8_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/85\/853\/853797bb-7c36-47b6-9de4-5a0708fa9a54.jpg"},{"id":56161,"image":"https:\/\/diptera.info\/forum\/attachments\/bradysia_02_15-02-2012.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/23\/236\/236350dc-9a25-475f-b3d0-2e93c2f8d8bf.jpg"}]},{"id":1272,"name":"Garden pebble moth","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Evergestis forficalis","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003EThe wingspan is 25\u0026ndash;28 mm.

Grape and obscure mealybugs lay yellow to orange eggs within an egg sac; longtailed mealybugs give birth to live crawlers. Crawlers of all three species are yellow to orange-brown in color. The grape mealybug has two generations each year and overwinters as an egg or crawler in or near a white, cottony egg sac under loose bark and in the cordons or upper portions of the trunk. In spring most grape mealybug crawlers move toward the base of spurs, or under the loose bark of canes, and then onto expanding green shoots, reaching maturity in mid-May to early June. Most females return to old wood to lay eggs that hatch from mid-June to July. First generation crawlers then move out to the green portions of the vine to feed on fruit and foliage in late June or early July; mostly immatures are seen through July. Adult females will appear in late summer and early fall. Some females will oviposit in the fruit clusters but the majority of the females return to the old wood to lay the overwintering eggs.\u003Cbr \/\u003EObscure and longtailed mealybugs do not diapause over the winter and have multiple overlapping generations with all life stages present on the vines year round. Obscure mealybug overwinters under the bark of the trunk, cordons, and spurs (the same as grape mealybug).

If the color of the fluid excreted is reddish orange, then it is most likely grape mealybug; if it is clear, it is most likely obscure mealybug. Another distinguishing characteristic is based on the different life cycles of the two species: grape mealybug diapauses in winter and has two generations a year that do not overlap. Consequently, if only one or two life stages of a mealybug are present at a given time, it is most likely a grape mealybug because obscure mealybug does not diapause and thus all life stages are present throughout the year.\u003Cbr \/\u003ELongtailed mealybug is similar in appearance to the other two species but has much longer waxy filaments on the posterior end (they are as long or longer than the body of the adult female).

The cooler start to the 2013 growing season, followed by the wet conditions of this summer, have fostered ideal hop aphid habitat. Hop aphids are pear shaped and range from yellow to light green in color. These soft bodied insects are found on the underside of hop leaves. Immature individuals are wingless while adult females have wings. All hop aphid life stages are seen on hops. Hop aphids do not overwinter on hops but on an alternate host plant within the Prunus genus.\u003Cbr \/\u003EHop aphids have piercing sucking mouthparts which are used to suck the phloem out of the plant. They secrete a sugary substance called \u0022honey dew\u0022. This substance when secreted especially in hop cones, provides the perfect habitat for sooty mold fungi to grow. Plant productivity is reduced by aphid feeding on foliage yet the greater yield and quality problem that hop aphids cause is sooty mold. Aesthetic cone damage and decreased cone quality from sooty mold will diminish cone marketability. Often, hop aphid populations can be managed by an assemblage of natural enemy arthropods.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAphid populations will be most successful on plant parts highest in nitrogen and in hopyards with higher levels of nitrogen. However, all hop plants need adequate amendments of nitrogen for growth. The Pacific Northwest hop-growing region recommends an economic threshold of 8-10 hop aphid individuals per leaf.

In the Pacific Northwest, the pupa develops over a 2- to 3-week period in early spring. Adult emergence begins in early April, depending on weather conditions, and adults that develop from overwintering larvae may be active until early June.\u003Cbr \/\u003ESoon after emerging, adults mate and females lay eggs on leaf surfaces or fruit. Eggs hatch in 7 to 10 days. Larvae feed on the fruit immediately after hatching and continue to feed for 18 to 24 days. When mature, they spin tightly woven cocoons in debris or fruit on the ground or under bark scales on the tree.\u003Cbr \/\u003ESecond generation adults are active from mid-June through early August. Moths from this generation tend to deposit more of their eggs on fruit than on leaves. After maturing, the larvae spin cocoons and most overwinter. In some years, a third flight of adults may occur.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"lesser-appleworm-1","images":[{"id":71986,"image":"http:\/\/mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu\/Files1\/Live\/MD\/MD3428-300.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/a\/ae\/ae7\/ae7b1e41-fae7-417e-ac4c-543a02d25d58.jpg"},{"id":71988,"image":"http:\/\/www.ontariomoths.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/3429-Grapholita-prunivora-IMG_4964-copy-590x402.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/a\/af\/af8\/af8a64c4-38d8-4763-9ebd-97e244ed3fa8.jpg"},{"id":71991,"image":"http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/leps\/tortai\/large\/images\/Grapholita_prunivora\/prunivora_1949057.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/3c\/3c4\/3c4e6674-e49a-4cdb-b789-ad57b1228412.jpg"},{"id":71992,"image":"http:\/\/mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu\/Files1\/Live\/CherylM\/CherylM3429a-225.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/4d\/4df\/4dfa1286-6c01-4723-baa5-93631c65b707.jpg"},{"id":71993,"image":"http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/leps\/tortai\/large\/images\/Grapholita_prunivora\/prunivora1.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/e4\/e4d\/e4da5274-f9d0-43ef-8647-afcfefc5efa7.jpg"},{"id":71994,"image":"http:\/\/mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu\/Files1\/Live\/ArloP\/ArloP3429-300-cat.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/a\/af\/af0\/af03974a-78c5-4f24-9e10-7a1be401bf83.jpg"}]},{"id":1317,"name":"Lesser grain borer","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Rhyzopertha dominica","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003EAdults are dark reddish brown and 3 mm long with distinctly shaped, loose 3-segmented club.\u0026nbsp;Larvae are white and c-shaped.

In northern Alberta, overwintered adults emerge in the early spring (e.g., early May) to seek out early growing vegetation such as willows breaking bud, and then move onto rapidly growing winter annual weeds like stinkweed or flixweed. Overwintering adults can also be abundant in volunteer canola, early spring seeded canola, especially if these crops are in bud or flower and other hosts are not yet available. After mating in May through early July females seek suitable host plants, such as budding alfalfa or canola, on which to lay their eggs. Eggs are laid individually into the stems and leaves of host plants. The first nymphs appear by about the end of May. In the south, the new generation adults first appear by about the end of June. Nymphs (first to fifth instars) can emerge and develop on these earlier season weed hosts, but usually adults relocate to or even emerge from overwintering in alfalfa and clovers in mid-spring.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIdentify\u003C\/strong\u003E. Adult lygus bugs are about 3 mm (0.1\u0022) wide and 6 mm (0.2\u0022) long. They have relatively long antennae and legs. They vary from pale green to reddish brown to black and can be fairly uniform colour ranging to a mottled appearance. Lygus bugs have a distinctive triangle or \u0022V\u0022 shaped marking in the upper centre of their backs and membranous wing tips. Adults are active and fly readily when approached.\u003Cbr \/\u003EImmature lygus bugs (nymphs) are light green and wingless. Young nymphs are often mistaken for aphids, which are similar in size and shape. However, lygus bug nymphs are much more active, are harder bodied and lack the cornicles (\u0022tail pipes\u0022) of aphids. Nymphs feed on new growth and reproductive parts of the plant. Several black spots, usually five, become noticeable on the backs of nymphs as they moult or mature through five instars (growth stages) before becoming adults. Wing buds are evident on the dorsal side of fourth and fifth instars.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"lygus-bug-1","images":[{"id":71971,"image":"http:\/\/www.boldsystems.org\/pics\/_w300\/EUBUG\/EUBUG_880_m_Lygugeme1%2B1326861074.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/e1\/e11\/e110508b-4d33-4259-8975-97d1685907dd.jpg"},{"id":71972,"image":"http:\/\/www.canolawatch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/L-keltoni.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/a\/ad\/ad7\/ad7a92a6-c413-4252-aee0-1657bc808d6b.jpg"},{"id":71973,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/41\/Lygus_pratensis01.jpg\/1200px-Lygus_pratensis01.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/d\/d1\/d14\/d14e3e61-3fb6-457e-a4fa-0d52a4fd2526.jpg"},{"id":71974,"image":"http:\/\/www.boldsystems.org\/pics\/_w300\/BBHCN\/10bbchem-0781%2B1292859992.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/84\/84d\/84de9611-ca7e-42e8-9e62-550955705c11.jpg"},{"id":71976,"image":"http:\/\/bugguide.net\/images\/raw\/ZLP\/ZZL\/ZLPZZLWZLLWZ8LWZMLAZGLVZMLYHUHAZ5LHRILLRUHLRNHOHMH5ZKLAHXHTHNH1ZGLZREHNZ6HNZLL.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/42\/429\/4291a0a3-0a65-4d60-8e4e-940836401530.jpg"}]},{"id":1469,"name":"Maize weevil","nameSynonyms":"greater rice weevil","latinName":"Sitophilus zeamais","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003EThe maize weevil has a length of 2.5 mm to 4 mm.

The mature larva is from 6.0 to 9.5 mm in length, and greenish yellow. The larva molts four times during the time of development.

After feeding on the tender young bean plants for one to two weeks, the females lay their eggs, each depositing 500 to 600 of them in batches of 40 to 75 on the underside of the foliage.

When first hatched, they all feed together. If the leaf is somewhat dry, the first hatched may devour the remaining unhatched eggs.

When pupating, the larva fastens the tip of the abdomen to a part of the plant and starts to wiggle out of the larval skin, not entirely shedding it but pushing it back until only the tip of the abdomen remains in the skin. The pupal stage lasts for five to ten days, but may drag out much longer in the cool weather of autumn. The adults are strong fliers and travel long distances hunting for new bean fields.

Each species selects the situation of the water into which it lays its eggs and does so according to its own ecological adaptations. Some are generalists and are not very fussy. Some breed in lakes, some in temporary puddles. Some breed in marshes, some in salt-marshes. Among those that breed in salt water, some are equally at home in fresh and salt water up to about one-third the concentration of seawater, whereas others must acclimatize themselves to the salinity.\u0026nbsp;Such differences are important because certain ecological preferences keep mosquitoes away from most humans, whereas other preferences bring them right into houses at night.\u003Cbr \/\u003ESome species of mosquitoes prefer to breed in phytotelmata\u0026nbsp;(natural reservoirs on plants), such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks, or in the leaf-axils of bromeliads.

In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial water containers. Such casual puddles are important breeding places for some of the most serious disease vectors, such as species of\u0026nbsp;Aedes\u0026nbsp;that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up pathogens\u0026nbsp;from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, and if they do happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe first three stages\u0026mdash;egg, larva, and pupa\u0026mdash;are largely aquatic. These stages typically last 5 to 14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions. Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or waterless spend part of the year in\u0026nbsp;diapause; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance,\u0026nbsp;\u003Cem\u003EWyeomyia\u003C\/em\u003E\u0026nbsp;larvae typically get frozen into solid lumps of ice during winter and only complete their development in spring.

Eggs are 0.8 mm long, white and flask shaped. Mullein bugs develop through five nymphal instars to adults. Nymphs are 0.5-2.5 mm long, yellow, with a pointed head and red eyes. There are several similar insects such as aphids and leafhoppers that can be confused with mullein bug nymphs. Adults mullein bugs are 3 mm long, oval and light green to tan in colour.

The mullein bug has two major plant hosts, the mullein plant and apple. Occasionally it also attacks pear, grapes, wild rose, serviceberry and oak. The insect overwinters as eggs inserted deep into the bark of one- or two-year-old wood of apple. Eggs begin hatching during bloom and continue to hatch into the petal fall period. Most years the hatch is synchronized with peak emergence at early petal fall, but a cold snap during this time may result in split hatch, making chemical control more difficult.\u003Cbr \/\u003ENymphs initially feed on plant sap attained from leaf veins, and also sting developing fruitlets. Several weeks after petal fall, nymphs become predaceous and begin feeding on prey such as European red mite and aphids. Nymphs with red bellies are an indication the nymphs have been feeding on mites. Nymphs progress through five instars before becoming adults. Both nymphs and adults are fast moving, and adults are often quick to take flight if disturbed. The adults migrate to mullein plants, common along ditch banks and the sides of roadways in Ontario, where they feed throughout the summer months. Season-long monitoring in apple orchards indicates some mullein bugs remain in the orchard during the summer. During that time they are considered important predators of aphids and mites. In late fall, female mullein bugs return to apple trees and lay overwintering eggs into young wood. There are two to three generations per year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. During bloom to petal fall period, mullein bug nymphs cause economic losses to certain varieties of apple, particularly Red Delicious and Spartan. Northern Spy, Empire, Cortland, Gala, Jonagold and Golden Delicious are also sometimes affected. McIntosh and other cultivars seem to be largely unaffected, but it is not known whether mullein bug does not generally attack fruit of these cultivars, or if these cultivars are immune to mullein bug stings. Feeding on fruit causes small upraised, reddish bumps on the fruit surface. Fruit often receive multiple stings and the large majority of these abort just prior to or during June drop. Affected fruit that remain on the tree develop small corky warts or bumps surrounded by conical depressions. As affected fruit sizes through the summer, it becomes distorted. If uncontrolled, mullein bug can damage up to 75% of apples in Ontario orchards.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"mullein-bug","images":[{"id":10194,"image":"http:\/\/www.biodiversidadvirtual.org\/insectarium\/data\/media\/26284\/Campylomma-verbasci-393765.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/00\/00e\/00e0bef0-0776-454e-960b-0f463ecfd410.jpg"},{"id":10195,"image":"http:\/\/insects.fi\/kuvapankki\/images\/Heteroptera\/Miridae\/Campylomma\/verbasci\/Campylomma%20verbasci%2004.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/ec\/ec1\/ec1ce0cf-37b7-4be4-9f0a-27fbc6646365.jpg"},{"id":10197,"image":"http:\/\/insects.fi\/kuvapankki\/images\/Heteroptera\/Miridae\/Campylomma\/verbasci\/Campylomma%20verbasci%2002.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/cb\/cb7\/cb736c61-cb1b-47cc-a17b-636e8c506135.jpg"},{"id":10198,"image":"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/7\/6071\/6066493158_a5a8de2188_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/81\/81f\/81f7e689-eb1a-49e9-a095-2990ddf458b3.jpg"},{"id":10199,"image":"http:\/\/insects.fi\/kuvapankki\/images\/Heteroptera\/Miridae\/Campylomma\/verbasci\/Campylomma%20verbasci%2006.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/d\/d2\/d26\/d26da947-dc6f-47c2-bcea-3379af4a9f57.jpg"},{"id":10201,"image":"http:\/\/insects.fi\/kuvapankki\/images\/Heteroptera\/Miridae\/Campylomma\/verbasci\/Campylomma%20verbasci%2005.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/6\/61\/61a\/61a1114e-980b-4538-abb7-8ea197e81f1b.jpg"}]},{"id":5702,"name":"Multicolored Asian lady beetle","nameSynonyms":"Ladybug","latinName":"Harmonia axyridis","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription\u003C\/strong\u003E.\u0026nbsp;Multicolored Asian lady beetles are slightly larger than native lady beetles, with adults measuring 9\/32 inch (7 mm) long and 7\/32 inch (5.5 mm) wide.

A similar behavior is seen in their native Japan where the beetles fly to south-facing rock cliffs and outcroppings. There they enter cracks and crevices to overwinter.

Grape and obscure mealybugs lay yellow to orange eggs within an egg sac; longtailed mealybugs give birth to live crawlers. Crawlers of all three species are yellow to orange-brown in color. The grape mealybug has two generations each year and overwinters as an egg or crawler in or near a white, cottony egg sac under loose bark and in the cordons or upper portions of the trunk. In spring most grape mealybug crawlers move toward the base of spurs, or under the loose bark of canes, and then onto expanding green shoots, reaching maturity in mid-May to early June. Most females return to old wood to lay eggs that hatch from mid-June to July. First generation crawlers then move out to the green portions of the vine to feed on fruit and foliage in late June or early July; mostly immatures are seen through July. Adult females will appear in late summer and early fall. Some females will oviposit in the fruit clusters but the majority of the females return to the old wood to lay the overwintering eggs.\u003Cbr \/\u003EObscure and longtailed mealybugs do not diapause over the winter and have multiple overlapping generations with all life stages present on the vines year round. Obscure mealybug overwinters under the bark of the trunk, cordons, and spurs (the same as grape mealybug). In late spring some obscure mealybugs begin to feed on leaves, but the majority of the population remains hidden under the bark or in the tight clusters.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAppearance\u003C\/strong\u003E.

One method of distinguishing them in the field is to gently probe a female with a sharp point (without puncturing the body) to elicit the release of a defensive excretion. If the color of the fluid excreted is reddish orange, then it is most likely grape mealybug; if it is clear, it is most likely obscure mealybug. Another distinguishing characteristic is based on the different life cycles of the two species: grape mealybug diapauses in winter and has two generations a year that do not overlap. Consequently, if only one or two life stages of a mealybug are present at a given time, it is most likely a grape mealybug because obscure mealybug does not diapause and thus all life stages are present throughout the year.\u003Cbr \/\u003ELongtailed mealybug is similar in appearance to the other two species but has much longer waxy filaments on the posterior end (they are as long or longer than the body of the adult female).

The moth flight coincides with tillage and planting of winter wheat. Moths are attracted to areas with loose soil to deposit their eggs. Each female lays 250-300 eggs in the upper 1\/2 inch of soil.

A dark spot on the top middle edge of both wings helps to distinguish pear psylla from other psylla. Tiny, elongated yellowish eggs, which are barely visible without a hand lens, are laid on or near fruit spurs starting in late January or early February. As buds open, females lay eggs along midribs and petioles of developing leaves or on stems and leaves of blossoms. Pear psylla nymphs pass through five instars, four of which are almost completely encased in honeydew. When first hatched, the tiny nymphs are yellow with red eyes and black antennae.

Pear decline has varying effects on the trees depending on variety, rootstock, quality of the growing site, and pear psylla numbers.\u003Cbr \/\u003EHoneydew, produced by psylla nymphs as they feed, drops onto fruit. A black sooty mold grows on the honeydew and the fruit skin russets, which downgrades fruit for fresh-market use.

Rust mites are so small that you need a 14 to 20 X hand lens to see them. They are wedge-shaped, with the wider end at the head. Pale brown female mites overwinter in bark crevices or behind loose bud scales usually on 2- to 4-year-old wood. As buds open in spring they move to developing clusters, leaves, and fruit to feed.

Feeding and russetting may spread over the entire fruit if mites are unchecked. Late-season feeding tends to be scattered more uniformly over the fruit surface, with the intensity of russetting determined by the number of mites and the length of their feeding period.

Due to it\u0027s feeding habits, it can cause damage that is out of proportion to it\u0027s density. Most problems in vegetables show up in snap beans or potatoes, but it is capable of successful reproduction on over 200 plants species in 25 different families, including alfalfa, potatoes, beans, peanuts, and woody ornamentals. Potato leafhopper is a transient pest of apples, grapes, celery, rhubarb, and clover to name a few. Densities are typically highest in alfalfa.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe potato leafhopper overwinters to the south of us. Migrant source populations develop in the Gulf States in early spring, where they overwinter on legume host plants, but may also be found on a variety of native, evergreen plants. It has been tentatively demonstrated that the potato leafhopper feeds on loblolly pine, and the leafhopper\u0027s overwintering area spans the entire southern pine region and may extend into coastal areas where evergreen hosts are available.\u003Cbr \/\u003EMost overwintering females are mated and in reproductive diapause (their reproduction is delayed). These migrants arrive in Pennsylvania during the spring and early summer and they move northward, recolonizing its entire range from its overwintering source. The summer range spans most of the temperate latitudes east of 100 longitude. Some authors have suggested a \u0022pied-piper\u0022 hypothesis for the broad patterns of northward expansion of many pest species, where agricultural activities have provided temporarily suitable habitats for many highly mobile species that are geographically far from suitable overwintering locations. The possibility of some return flow to the south, along with some adult diapause, is currently an open research question.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe sex ratios of our populations shift during the season. The long-distance migrants are predominantly female. A sex ratio of 25 females to 1 male was recorded entering an alfalfa field in May in Pennsylvania. All females were gravid and able to initiate a new generation. The sex ratio changed to approximately 3:1 on second harvest and 1:1 on third harvest. The sex ratio of eggs is 1:1 and adult populations maintain stable 1:1 sex ratios by midseason and thereafter.\u003Cbr \/\u003EPotato leafhopper develops 3 to 4 generations during its residence in its summer range. One important factor that regulates populations is alfalfa harvest. Harvest destroys eggs and nymphs, and sends adults flying. Recolonization of alfalfa regrowth and vegetable crops occurs by invasion of adults from those populations adjacent to alfalfa fields or neighboring alfalfa fields on adjacent farms.\u003Cbr \/\u003EEggs are deposited within the plant. Most are in the upper more succulent tissue. On alfalfa, eggs are laid in the top 17 cm or upper one fourth of the plant. In potatoes, eggs are laid more frequently in the terminal leaflets and on leaves between apical and basal leaves. Egg-laying activity is maximum during the dark hours. Very little egg-laying occurs below 18.3 C. Females lay about 2 to 4 eggs per day, and somewhere between 30 and 200 eggs per female over a female\u0027s lifetime. In the lab, a female lives about 100 to 120 days.\u003Cbr \/\u003EEgg-hatch occurs in 9 1\/2 to 11 days at 75 F. After hatching, nymphs undergo five instars. The newly emerged nymph is nearly colorless with red spots that quickly fade. A yellow color soon appears, changing to pale green in the third instar. The time of development varies greatly with temperature, but average duration of each of the 1st through 5th instars respectively are: 2.6, 2.3, 2.3, 2.5, and 4.7 days. Mating occurs within 48 h of adult emergence with females beginning to lay eggs in three days. The average reproductive life was 30-35 days for females and 33 days for males.\u003Cbr \/\u003ELeafhopper feeding results in symptoms called \u0022hopperburn\u0022. The adults use the lacerate-and-flush style of probing in and around vascular tissue. Potato leafhoppers move its stylets steadly through cells, secreting full salivary sheaths only rarely. This lacerate-and-flush feeding style results in disorganization of vascular bundles, enlargement and proliferation of cells, collapse of phloem fibers, and eventual collapse of phloem sieve elements. It seems likely that both introduction of saliva from the leafhopper and mechanical wounding by stylet movememt is necessary to cause the injury, which is a saliva-enhanced wound response associated with vascular blockage.

Potato psyllids look like small cicadas, about 0.08 inch (2 mm) long. They are related to aphids and leafhoppers. The adult has clear wings that rest rooflike over the body. Although predominantly black, the potato psyllid does possess white markings. The first abdominal segment shows a broad white band, the last segment has an inverted white \u0022V\u0022. Psyllids jump quite readily when disturbed.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe football-shaped eggs are extremely small, slightly larger than leaf hairs, and on a short stalk. They are usually on the underside of the leaf along the edge and in the upper plant canopy. A 10X hand lens is required to see them.\u003Cbr \/\u003EPsyllid nymphs look like immature soft scale or whiteflies. Unlike whiteflies, when disturbed, they move quite readily. They are flat and green with a fringe of short spines around the edge. The immatures go through five instars in as little as 13 days.\u003Cbr \/\u003EPsyllids used to be an occasional problem in California in certain years when they would migrate into the state from Mexico. In recent years, however, a more invasive form of the species has been found in California that has the ability to overwinter in parts of southern California. Potato psyllid now occurs on a yearly basis in these areas and has become a chronic problem.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. Damage is caused by a toxin that the immatures produce when they feed. The toxin causes a plant response known as psyllid yellows. Symptoms include an upward curling of leaflets nearest the stem on the top part of the plant. As the disease establishes itself, this symptom becomes more evident. Plant yellowing is the most common symptom. The yellowing (in some varieties, purpling) is initially found on the leaf edges.\u003Cbr \/\u003ESevere symptoms include overall yellowing with enlarged nodes, development of clusters of small leaves in the axillary buds that appear rosetted, and the formation of aerial tubers. Internodes are shortened and the plant eventually is dwarfed and appears pyramid shaped. The nature of psyllid yellows is unlike a virus. (Do not confuse psyllid yellows with the symptoms of calico virus. Symptoms of calico virus are not uniformly distributed and leaf rosetting is not present.) If the immature psyllids are removed from the plant, the progression of the disease will stop. As few as three or four nymphs per plant can produce symptoms but more are needed for severe symptoms.\u003Cbr \/\u003EPsyllids also vector an organism that is responsible for a condition known as zebra chip. The organism causes sugars to accumulate in areas of the tuber instead of starch; affected tubers have dark lines throughout the entire length. In chipping varieties, these areas turn black when the chips are fried, creating a black, striped effect that gives rise to the name \u0022zebra chip\u0022. Infested plants produce fewer tubers. Yield losses from 20 to 50% have been reported. Tubers that are produced on plants attacked early in development will prematurely sprout in storage.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"potato-psyllid-1","images":[{"id":38042,"image":"http:\/\/images.slideplayer.com\/27\/9095881\/slides\/slide_22.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/fb\/fb0\/fb0929ed-7c89-4695-b4be-aab00d7775c4.jpg"},{"id":72062,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/8a\/Potato_psyllid.jpg\/1200px-Potato_psyllid.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/b4\/b4b\/b4b0777f-83d9-4531-94b6-8e767ebc64d7.jpg"},{"id":72063,"image":"http:\/\/bugguide.net\/images\/raw\/DR0\/QJR\/DR0QJR7QJRKQORJKJQG0TQP0K050NRG0FQ803QM0YQ80FQHQCQRQFRXQBR80DQG0YQJKNRLQWR80AR.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/4d\/4dc\/4dcdddb5-1760-4570-b654-e17c94e5f6bb.jpg"},{"id":72065,"image":"http:\/\/entoweb.okstate.edu\/ddd\/IMAGES\/potatopsyllid.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/7\/74\/74e\/74e419ad-481b-479f-948f-a0ddb38b68de.jpg"},{"id":72066,"image":"http:\/\/calphotos.berkeley.edu\/imgs\/512x768\/0000_0000\/1108\/1006.jpeg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/6\/64\/64c\/64cfcbc7-8245-4113-b2ce-7696079a4c6f.jpg"},{"id":72067,"image":"http:\/\/calphotos.berkeley.edu\/imgs\/512x768\/0000_0000\/0612\/1917.jpeg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/1\/12\/125\/12506bd8-1e1f-47b1-a841-1c43e61d0ac7.jpg"}]},{"id":4860,"name":"Purple-backed cabbageworm","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Evergestis pallidata","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIdentification od Adults:\u003C\/strong\u003E forewing pale yellowish to light brown with sharp median and PM lines;

Affected fruit are readily recognised since rots develop rapidly and the skin around the sting marks becomes discoloured. Queensland fruit fly damage is more severe during mid and late summer than at other times. Large numbers of flies can be expected after good falls of summer rain; fruit flies become active after periods of rain or high humidity. To monitor fruit fly activity hang male lure traps under the shady canopy, where flies tend to rest. Check the number of flies trapped each week. The recommended trap contains a synthetic attractant combined with a fumigant insecticide. Growers need to seriously consider whether fruit flies are causing sufficient damage to warrant spraying. A number of traps (one per hectare) should be hung in the middle of each large orchard block of 5.0 ha or more according to manufacturer\u0027s instructions. Inspect traps at weekly intervals from the end of flowering and until the completion of harvesting.

The name of the pest refers to the distinct reddish-brown band extending across the wings, and its habit of rolling, folding, or attaching leaves together. The RBLR measures 6.3 to 9.5 mm (3\/8 to 1\/4 in.) long. The male is smaller than the female, and has a slender, tubular abdomen with a tuft of hairs at the tip. The female\u0027s abdomen is wider than the male\u0027s, spindle-shaped, and bluntly rounded at the end.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe first RBLR moths emerge in the spring from overwintered pupae in the ground cover, before or soon after the green-tip stage of apple (early April). This first flight peaks in the tight cluster to pink bud stages. The moths can be found resting on trunks and scaffold limbs, and can sometimes be flushed from the ground cover. The second adult flight occurs from mid-June to mid-July, and the third flight, if it occurs, is from late August to mid September.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEggs\u003C\/strong\u003E are laid in groups of a few to nearly 150, but a typical egg mass usually contains about 40 eggs deposited in oval patches\u0026nbsp;that measure 3.0 by 5.0 mm ( 1\/16 by 3\/16 in.). The eggs resemble overlapping scales in the patch, and are pale yellowish or cream colored. Each egg is about 0.8 mm (1\/32 in.) in diameter. First brood eggs appear in the pink to early-bloom periods, and are laid primarily on the trunk and scaffold limb bark; hatch coincides with the petal fall stage of apples (mid-May). The summer brood eggs, which are more difficult to find, are laid mostly on the upper surfaces of leaves.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe larva\u003C\/strong\u003E is small, unmarked, and green to pale yellow, depending on the food consumed. The head capsule and thoracic shield (the hardened plate behind the head) are the same color (green to yellow) as the rest of the body. This is important in distinguishing RBLR from other leafrollers, in which the head and thoracic shield are darker than the rest of the body. Newly-emerged larvae are about 1.6 mm (1\/16 in.) long; the last larval stage is about 16 mm (5\/8 in.) long.\u003Cbr \/\u003EFirst brood larvae crawl along trunks and limbs in search of leaves to eat; watersprouts are readily accepted as food. Small larvae feed on leaf undersides near the midrib or large veins, and spin a flimsy web, which expands as the larva grows. Larvae are more likely to feed on fruit as they grow. As with the first brood larvae, those of the second brood feed on the undersides of leaves within a web. In late August and early September they begin to move about on the tree and feed more on fruit, and this feeding may continue until October, when they fold a leaf around themselves and pupate within.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPupae\u003C\/strong\u003E are initially greenish-brown, but later turn a deep brown.

Some of the puparia are found on top of the potting mix or are very close to the surface. A new generation of adult flies emerges 4 to 5 days later.

The soybean aphid, a native of Asia, has been in the Midwest since 2000 and has quickly become the most serious pest of soybeans in much of Indiana. These aphids are small (less than 1\/16\u0022 in length), yellow-bodied insects with distinct black cornicles, and may be either winged or wingless. They are typically slow-moving and often found on the underside of the newest growth on a soybean plant.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs with many aphids, the soybean aphid has a complicated life cycle, that requires the presence of its overwintering host, Rhamnus cathartica, or buckthorn. Like the soybean aphid, this plant is an introduced species, and is now found throughout much of the Midwestern U.S. One important feature of the lifecycle is the ability of female soybean aphid to reproduce live, female offspring (clones) parthenogenically during the summer months. This means that soybean aphid numbers can often increase rapidly when conditions are favorable in a soybean field. Soybean aphid are usually found in soybeans from late May through August.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. The soybean aphid feeds using sucking, needle-like mouthparts to extract plant juices. If aphids are present in large numbers, this feeding may cause a reduction in plant vigor and growth rates, as well as leaf puckering, reduced pod\/seed counts, and ultimately reduced yield. Severity of damage varies widely depending on pressure and other variables present in the field, although yield losses ranging from 10% to 15% are not uncommon. It is important to remember that aphid damage is exacerbated by other stressors on the plant (eg. drought) and stressed plants are, in turn, more favorable hosts for aphids, resulting in increased reproductive rates. Aphid honeydew, produced as a waste product during feeding, promotes the development of gray, sooty mold on leaf surfaces, reducing photosynthetic capacity of plants\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"soybean-aphids","images":[{"id":6074,"image":"https:\/\/beetlesinthebush.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/08\/img_0869_enh_1080x720.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/b3\/b31\/b3197b85-ff73-4f14-bfe2-504d9432a4de.jpg"},{"id":6076,"image":"https:\/\/beetlesinthebush.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/08\/img_0868_enh_1080x720.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/a\/af\/af0\/af05de75-0a82-4183-a068-fd0d1709321e.jpg"},{"id":6078,"image":"https:\/\/beetlesinthebush.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/08\/img_0878_enh_1080x720.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/4b\/4bc\/4bc28d2f-c296-44da-a630-d5a6fea81981.jpg"},{"id":6079,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/3d\/Aphis_glycines_5268061.jpg\/1024px-Aphis_glycines_5268061.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/35\/35f\/35f7217c-d8b2-42ec-8793-25ed10ccb626.jpg"},{"id":6080,"image":"https:\/\/beetlesinthebush.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/08\/img_0870_enh_1080x720.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/91\/915\/9154cd8a-608f-4550-a8ae-8f03d2ebedbf.jpg"}]},{"id":4775,"name":"Soybean cyst nematode","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Heterodera glycines","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe second-stage juvenile, or J2, nematode is the only life stage that can penetrate roots.

The J2 induces cell division in the root to form specialized feeding sites. As the nematode feeds, it swells. The female swells so much that her posterior end bursts out of the root and she becomes visible to the naked eye. In contrast, the adult male regains a wormlike shape, and he leaves the root in order to find and fertilize the large females. The female continues to feed as she lays 200 to 400 eggs in a yellow gelatinous matrix, forming an egg sac which remains inside her. She then dies and her cuticle hardens forming a cyst. The eggs may hatch when conditions in the soil are favorable, the larvae developing inside the cyst and the biological cycle repeating itself. There are usually three generations in the year.

The female moth lays eggs on the flat undersurface of balsam fir or spruce needles, generally within 3 inches of the buds or defoliated area. In extremely high populations, eggs may be laid on almost any surface. Eggs are distributed more evenly on foliage of host trees in the Northeastern United States and eastern Canada than on those of western species. The eggs hatch in about 2 weeks. Usually, newly hatched larvae immediately seek a suitable place to spin their hibernacula or cocoon-like shelters. However, during warm periods, larvae may move about and feed on needles before spinning a hibernaculum. In doing so, they may spin down from a branch on a silken thread and be carried away by air currents. Larval dispersal at this stage is one means of spread within and beyond the infested stands. The young larva transforms into the second instar or stage within the hibernaculum and remains dormant over the winter. Old staminate flower bracts are preferred as overwintering sites, but bud scales and bark crevices are also used.\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn the spring-after several days of warm weather, but before the balsam fir buds begin to expand - the larva emerges from hibernation and begins feeding. Early feeding is first confined to the new buds of staminate flowers if present, or the larva mines the previous year\u0027s needles if staminate flowers are scarce. The new flower buds provide a ready source of food before the vegetative buds expand. The early emerging larvae that feed on staminate flower buds grow much more rapidly and have a higher survival rate than those that feed on old needles.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe larva migrates to the end of a twig and bores into a needle or an expanding vegetative bud. Some larvae spin down on silken threads and, as first instar larvae, may be dispersed by air currents. The larvae feeding on staminate flower buds and flowers stay in place until the immediate food supply is depleted. Later, the larva feeds on the new foliage of developing shoots. When the larva is in the fifth instar, it begins tying the tips of twigs together with silk, forming a small nest. The new foliage is eaten first. In epidemic situations, old needles and bark (near branch tips) may also be consumed to such a degree that branch tips and terminal shoots are destroyed. During late June through mid-July, depending on the weather, the larva completes development and stops feeding.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe larva then transforms to a pupa, generally within the last-formed webbing. Some pupae are found at the axils (needle base) of the twigs. The moth emerges about 10 days later (in late June through mid-July). Peak moth flight activity occurs from about 7:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Moths may be carried up to 10 miles or more by winds and can be transported hundreds of miles by storm fronts.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"spruce-budworm","images":[{"id":8927,"image":"http:\/\/dkbdigitaldesigns.com\/clm\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/CLM-8869.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/8b\/8b5\/8b5575d8-f9aa-4495-bb4c-26cafbf24058.jpg"},{"id":8928,"image":"https:\/\/c2.staticflickr.com\/8\/7539\/15585015737_914d4b5273_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/8d\/8d8\/8d8d4912-f28e-4932-a0e7-52d8d00e0093.jpg"},{"id":8929,"image":"http:\/\/dkbdigitaldesigns.com\/clm\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/CLM-1770.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/0d\/0d4\/0d4ce245-6208-4724-be8f-85ead9461d12.jpg"},{"id":8931,"image":"http:\/\/dkbdigitaldesigns.com\/clm\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/CLM-7954.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/0f\/0fe\/0fe3acbd-be30-4965-914c-7e0b26bd176b.jpg"},{"id":8932,"image":"https:\/\/gd.eppo.int\/media\/data\/taxon\/C\/CHONFU\/pics\/1024x0\/394.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/36\/36a\/36adcebf-fc5a-468d-bfa0-e637a86aae36.jpg"},{"id":8933,"image":"http:\/\/dkbdigitaldesigns.com\/clm\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/CLM-8831.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/f9\/f9d\/f9dc8309-1b27-405b-8ba0-9c9fa90ec6ec.jpg"}]},{"id":5131,"name":"Spruce cone axis midge","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Kaltenbachiola rachiphaga","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDistribution. \u003C\/strong\u003EWidespread throughout host ranges in Alaska, Canada, and northeastern and northwestern United States.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage. \u003C\/strong\u003ELarvae tunnel through scale tissue (usually no more than one larva per scale) and eventually into the cone axis, but do not attack seeds.

This dark reddish-brown weevil is about 1\/10 inch long with a head elongated into a slender, curved snout about half as long as the body. Its back has two large black spots. In the eastern United States, this insect is known as the \u0022strawberry clipper\u0022 or simply the \u0022clipper\u0022 because of its habit of clipping buds.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe beetles leave their winter quarters in fence rows and woodlots in the spring as temperatures approach 60 F, usually around the end of April. They immediately proceed to a number of plants with early fruit bud developments, of which strawberries are phenologically ideal. First, they feed on immature pollen by puncturing the blossom buds with their long snouts. The female deposits a single egg inside the nearly mature bud and then girdles the bud. She then clips the bud so it hangs by a mere thread or falls to the ground. In about one week, the egg hatches into a white, legless grub. The larva develops inside the bud and reaches maturity in 3 or 4 weeks.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAdult weevils emerge from the buds in June. After feeding on the pollen of various flowers for a short time, the new adults seek hibernating sites in midsummer and remain inactive for the rest of the season. Weevils remain in these sites until the next spring. Only one brood appears each year. Injury is most likely to occur when strawberries are grown adjacent to woodlots or other suitable hibernating quarters.\u003Cbr \/\u003EClipping begins in early May, and growers should check their field carefully at that time for the first signs of damage. To determine if a pesticide treatment is necessary, walk random rows of plants, keeping track of the number of cut buds per linear foot of row. Sample five separate 10-foot sections from throughout the field. Divide the total number of cut buds observed by the total number of linear row feet inspected.

As the larvae feed and spin silken threads, the dying florets and frass give the sunflower head a trashy appearance.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"sunflower-head-moth","images":[{"id":72130,"image":"http:\/\/mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu\/Files1\/JV\/300\/JV5935-300.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/8d\/8d2\/8d2b30b3-698e-48ae-a94a-6816ea733d01.jpg"},{"id":72131,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/5190036.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/6\/6b\/6b7\/6b77154a-920d-4e2d-8962-f56a3dda1933.jpg"},{"id":72132,"image":"https:\/\/photos.smugmug.com\/Pretty-Insects\/Insects\/i-FPMp9wK\/4\/42beaaf0\/X2\/sunflower%20moth2-X2.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/d\/d9\/d91\/d9190895-d42b-4702-b694-d0723625f5fb.jpg"},{"id":72135,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/5507038.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/99\/993\/993be5ef-5ad1-491d-8980-bc298bcc6622.jpg"},{"id":72136,"image":"http:\/\/bugguide.net\/images\/cache\/900\/0P0\/9000P0Q0I0YRFKCRQQ3RSQ3RHQNRRQ1RIQ3RHQBRHQCQHQ9RSQ9RFKFQJKTRXQJRLQFQ70NRM09RZQTQX0ARX0NRHQ.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/04\/045\/0454ae7e-6c10-440f-afc5-31fd23024839.jpg"}]},{"id":4749,"name":"Swede midge","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Contarinia nasturtii","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EContarinia nasturtii\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/strong\u003E, the \u003Cstrong\u003Eswede midge\u003C\/strong\u003E, is a small fly, the larvae of which infest brassica plants, causing twisting and distortion of the leaf stems and foliage including death of the growing point in seedlings, or damage to developing flower heads. It is native to Europe and Turkey, and has been introduced into North America where it is regarded as an invasive species.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife cycle\u003C\/strong\u003E. Adult swede midges are yellowish-brown and up to 2\u0026nbsp;mm (0.08\u0026nbsp;in) long, and live for up to three days. During this time the female lays about one hundred eggs in several batches on the leaves of suitable host plants. The eggs need moisture to hatch and the larvae emerge in between one and ten days at 30 to 10 C (86 to 50\u0026nbsp;F) respectively. They feed for between one and three weeks, again depending on temperature, and produce a gall. When fully grown they descend to the soil and either pupate in an oval cocoon at a depth of about 5\u0026nbsp;cm (2\u0026nbsp;in) or, in adverse weather conditions, become dormant in a globular cocoon buried deeper in the soil. The adults emerge one and a half to seven weeks after pupation and there are several generations each year.\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhen the dormancy period is due to drought, development continues after wetting, but when it is due to low temperature, development restarts only after a prolonged period of cold weather. The larvae then make their way to the soil surface before burying themselves shallowly and forming an oval cocoon.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. Host plants for the swede midge include cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and a number of wild plants in the brassica family including sheperd\u0026rsquo;s purse, field penny-cress, field peppergrass and yellow rocket. When a seedling or young plant is attacked, the larvae conglomerate and secrete saliva which softens the plant cuticle and epidermis, sucking in the resulting fluid. On a leaf stalk, this damages the tissues and results in the formation of a corky gall. The undamaged side of the stalk continues to grow normally which results in twisting and distortion. The growing point can be completely killed and secondary bacterial infections can occur. If the infection occurs in the flowering stage of cauliflower, it causes a stunted, multi-branched, tuft-like appearance of the flower-head.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Csup id=\u0022cite_ref-Readshaw_1-1\u0022 class=\u0022reference\u0022\u003E\u003C\/sup\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"swede-midge","images":[{"id":21928,"image":"https:\/\/escsecblog.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/adult-sm-cheung.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/4e\/4e3\/4e3f5aca-dd16-4ef0-b869-51590df91f1c.jpg"},{"id":21930,"image":"http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/citrus\/pests\/images\/fs_images\/0250.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/bd\/bd1\/bd16bf9d-e065-4db1-bcb1-315c06c8c705.jpg"},{"id":21937,"image":"http:\/\/www.omafra.gov.on.ca\/CropOp\/images\/crop_images\/specialty-veg\/brassicas\/bokc\/bokcf10_zoom.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/7\/71\/711\/7118e3c1-8790-4d2f-81a6-c1a134556b26.jpg"},{"id":54471,"image":"https:\/\/farm8.staticflickr.com\/7738\/18154719698_891503ff7a_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/c0\/c0d\/c0d02d0b-a420-43d7-b665-801eedd38f38.jpg"}]},{"id":12401,"name":"Sweetclover weevil","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Sitona cylindricollis","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe adult feeds on the foliage of legumes, especially yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis) and lucerne in spring and autumn.

Wing color is generally grayish at the base, gradually darkening to brown at the tips, with a lighter-colored margin along the leading edge of the wings. The moth is named for the tufted scales that can be seen as two or three groups on the tops of the wings. Moths are extremely well camouflaged on tree trunks.\u003Cbr \/\u003ELarvae are a light brown to grayish tan with a chestnut-brown head capsule, a darker prothoracic shield (hardened area between the head and body), and a dark stripe down the back of the body. This coloration distinguishes TABM larvae from various other leafrollers. The redbanded leafroller has a pale green body with a yellowish green head; the obliquebanded leafroller has a yellowish green body with a brown to black head and a pale-yellowish-green to black prothoracic shield; and the fruit-tree leafroller has a translucent apple-green body with a reddish to dark brown head and an amber prothoracic shield. Bud moths deposit their eggs in an ovoid apple-green mass consisting of as many as 150 eggs or more. The mass is usually deposited on the upper leaf surface, and along a leaf vein.\u003Cbr \/\u003ETABM produce two generations per year. Larvae overwinter as second through fourth instars in shelters such as leaves and decaying fruit beneath trees in apple, cherry, peach, and pear orchards and in woods. The larvae become active in early spring and complete their development on root suckers or various broadleaf weeds such as dandelion, dock, and wild strawberry in the ground cover. The larvae pupate and emerge as adults around the beginning of May. They start laying eggs about the beginning of June. First-instar larvae disperse by crawling or ballooning (floating on the wind). First and second instars then feed along a leaf midrib, and, beginning with the third instar, create shelters by rolling leaves, tying leaves to other leaves or fruit, and building shelters within fruit clusters. Larvae generally pupate within these shelters, emerge as adults, and begin second-brood egg-laying about the beginning of August. Late season, second-brood larvae (second through fourth instars) drop to the ground to overwinter as leaves fall in autumn.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlthough TABM belongs to a family of moths known as leafrollers, the leafrolling activity has little economic impact on the fruit growing operation and little physiological impact on the tree. It is when this insect webs a leaf onto the apple and feeds directly on the fruit that it becomes a pest. Damage appears as tiny holes (early instar feeding), as irregular scarring or gallerying of the apple surface, or as an area of rot, generally found around the stem. Rot or corking around the stem occurs usually after the larvae have finished feeding and have pupated. Larvae occasionally enter the apple calyx and feed unnoticed within the seed cavity. Most damage to apples is caused by second-brood feeding, although in some years first-brood damage can exceed that caused by the following generation. Damage to fruits destined for fresh markets has a greater economic impact, since their cash value is much higher than that of processing grade apples. Generally, TABM injury does not reduce the grade of processing apples, but it can affect the storageability of those apples by promoting decay.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"tufted-apple-bud-moth","images":[{"id":9157,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/08\/-_3740_%E2%80%93_Platynota_idaeusalis_%E2%80%93_Tufted_Apple_Budmoth_(14865092276).jpg\/880px--_3740_%E2%80%93_Platynota_idaeusalis_%E2%80%93_Tufted_Apple_Budmoth_(14865092276).jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/23\/231\/2313d466-9d8a-4b40-893a-1a9aecd3f309.jpg"},{"id":9159,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/23\/-_3740_%E2%80%93_Platynota_idaeusalis_%E2%80%93_Tufted_Apple_Budmoth_(14115357537).jpg\/774px--_3740_%E2%80%93_Platynota_idaeusalis_%E2%80%93_Tufted_Apple_Budmoth_(14115357537).jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/c4\/c48\/c48b93bb-8b97-4d20-8228-943433756b1b.jpg"},{"id":9164,"image":"https:\/\/farm1.staticflickr.com\/288\/19130479193_bd9e8a8d59_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/b3\/b37\/b37079f6-5978-4332-9e75-3bc7449f3ef9.jpg"},{"id":9165,"image":"http:\/\/marylandinsects.com\/images\/Platynota_idaeusalis_Tufted_Apple_Bud_Moth_PVSP.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/84\/84e\/84e20d1d-6786-4ee6-87c8-3b042586e6e9.jpg"},{"id":72173,"image":"http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/leps\/tortai\/large\/images\/Platynota_idaeusalis\/idaeusalis4.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/bf\/bf9\/bf9366ae-fd2e-4214-88d3-da1145e0e579.jpg"}]},{"id":1471,"name":"Turnip aphid","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Lipaphis erysimi","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdult\u003C\/strong\u003E - Very similar in appearance, these two aphid species are pale green and, most commonly, wingless.

The Western Bean Cutworm is a native of North America that has recently expanded its range eastward from the Great Plains region. Following its initial discovery in southeastern Iowa in 2004, it was found the following year in western Illinois and in northwestern Indiana in 2006. Although primarily known a pest of field corn in many areas, its broad host range also includes legumes and it can be a pest of dryland beans (but not soybeans), where they are grown in abundance. It is not a true \u0026ldquo;cutworm\u0026rdquo; in that it feeds on the reproductive parts of the plants, and not by cutting stems as many cutworms do. The western bean cutworm is a late-season pest and its feeding can cause both yield loss and degrade quality of grain.\u003Cbr \/\u003EOne generation occurs each year. Moths are primarily grayish-brown in color with a wing-span of approximately 1-1\/2\u0022. The primary identifying characteristics are a whitish stripe at the front of the forewing with two cream-colored, outlined shapes immediately behind. Other identifying marks are a circular spot approximately halfway along the length of the forewing and a kidney-shaped mark along the same line, approximately 2\/3 of the way to the wingtip.\u003Cbr \/\u003EMoth emergence begins in early July and usually peaks in the middle of the month, when male moths can be monitored using pheromone traps. Female moths will mate and lay eggs during July and August and will oviposit on a variety of cultivated and wild plants, although dryland beans and field corn are the most commonly chosen oviposition sites. Cornfields in the late whorl stage are preferred by female moths, who are seeking to lay eggs on corn that is near (but not past) pollination. Eggs will be laid on upper surfaces of leaves, often on leaves near the whorl that have not unfolded completely and vertical in orientation. Eggs are laid in masses of 20-200, but usually average around 50. Eggs are white when first laid, and become tan as eggs begin to develop. In about a week, eggs develop a purple coloration, indicating that hatch is imminent.\u003Cbr \/\u003EFollowing emergence, first-instar larvae will consume their eggshells, making post-hatch scouting for empty masses impossible. Larvae will then move into protected areas of the corn plant, feeding on leaf tissue, fallen anthers\/pollen and silks on their way to their destination, the developing ear. Newly-hatched larvae are initially dark with black heads, this color will lighten to a light tan or pinkish hue with subtle longitudinal stripes as they develop further. 4th-instar and larger larvae,\u0026nbsp;1\/2 to 1-1\/2 inches long, are readily identified by 2 black \u0026ldquo;rectangles\u0026rdquo; behind the now-orange head, and a generally smooth skin or cuticle (i.e. lacking tubercles, warts, or bumps). There are 6 larval instars, the 6th is most conspicuous and often found feeding on mature ears, usually the tip but sometimes the sides. Entry holes and\/or frass are not always visible, so scouting for larvae must include removing husks. Several larvae may be found on a single ear, because these caterpillars (unlike corn earworm) are not cannibalistic. In late summer and early fall, 6th instar larvae drop off the plant and burrow into the soil, where they construct an earthen chamber using salivary gland secretions. Sandier soils allow for larvae to penetrate deeper into the soil profile that increases winter survival and avoidance of tillage implements. They will remain in a quiescent state (pre-pupa) throughout the winter and will pupate and complete development during the following spring and early summer.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. Oviposition and subsequent damage are often very patchy in fields. Multiple larvae may feed on a single plant\/ear. In addition, there is likely considerable inter-plant movement early in life which results in infestation of neighboring plants. Most feeding is concentrated on the ear, and yield studies conducted in Iowa and Nebraska have shown that an average of one larva\/plant throughout the field may cause yield loss of approximately 4 bu\/acre. Damaged kernels are prone to molds, decreasing grain quality of food-grade corn varieties.

It overwinters as a pupa in the soil. The pupae are affected by soil temperature and do not all develop at the same rate. Adults begin to emerge in May, about 5 weeks before harvest, and are active until 3 or 4 weeks after harvest. Peak emergence often coincides with harvest.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAdults live 16 to 35 days, depending on temperatures. They feed on deposits on the leaves, such as honeydew and pollen. Adult females undergo a 7- to 10-day preoviposition period before they are sexually mature. After mating, they lay eggs under the skin of the fruit. Females frequently feed on juices exuding from the puncture made during egg laying.\u003Cbr \/\u003EEach female can lay from 50 to 200 eggs in a 3-week period. The optimum temperature for egg laying is between 75 and 85 F. The eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, and the larvae burrow towards the pit of the fruit where they are unreachable by most pesticides. When fully developed, 10 to 21 days after hatching, they bore their way out of the cherries and drop to the ground. Within a few hours they burrow into the soil to pupate. The majority develop into adults the following season, though a few remain dormant for two years.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDamage\u003C\/strong\u003E. Adults do no damage to fruit.

It also gives the mines a tent-like appearance from the upper leaf surface, with small white spots where the green tissue has been removed. The lower surface will often develop a \u0022seam\u0022 during this stage, where the tissue is bunched together longitudinally down the center of the mine. When full grown, the larvae are about 4 mm long, cylindrical, and white to pale green. Before they pupate, the larvae turn yellow.

The adults mate in the evening and, at dawn, females return to the ground to deposit 15 to 20 eggs, 1 to 8 inches deep in the soil.

The next autumn the larvae again migrate deep into the soil to overwinter, returning near the soil surface the following spring to feed on plant roots until they are fully grown in late spring. These grubs then form oval earthen cells and pupate. The adult beetles emerge from the pupal stage a few weeks later, but they do not leave the ground. The beetles overwinter in the soil, emerging the following year in May or June when feeding, mating, and egg-laying take place.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"white-grubs","images":[{"id":40092,"image":"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/3\/2845\/9692384703_f297b30ae8_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/f9\/f9b\/f9bc8b68-eb71-40d4-ba36-5d1bf29b8bf2.jpg"},{"id":40093,"image":"http:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/1233214.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/3d\/3de\/3dee5328-6a7e-46c1-ba36-0f68ec459ff6.jpg"},{"id":40094,"image":"http:\/\/images.slideplayer.com\/26\/8446995\/slides\/slide_3.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/f2\/f2e\/f2e538da-340e-4472-929d-ba83ce554233.jpg"},{"id":40095,"image":"http:\/\/www.intechopen.com\/source\/html\/43894\/media\/image1.jpeg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/b0\/b02\/b024384e-f7ea-46a6-b890-6e2a652554f5.jpg"},{"id":40096,"image":"http:\/\/keys.lucidcentral.org\/keys\/v3\/eafrinet\/maize_pests\/key\/maize_pests\/Media\/Html\/images\/White_Grubs\/Larva_Phyllophaga_sp.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/f3\/f3e\/f3e6d339-af1b-45aa-820d-fbf3bb6f5d4f.jpg"},{"id":40097,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/2121097.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/2e\/2e3\/2e31ae4c-e267-45e1-bf4b-d873c843e43a.jpg"},{"id":40098,"image":"http:\/\/keys.lucidcentral.org\/keys\/v3\/eafrinet\/maize_pests\/key\/maize_pests\/Media\/Html\/images\/White_Grubs\/phyllophaga-sp_jpg.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/e9\/e9a\/e9ade734-cfe9-483c-b3aa-9ed1dc2be94d.jpg"},{"id":40099,"image":"http:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/1233213.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/5\/53\/539\/53939073-18e9-475f-b22e-ec0a22acf6aa.jpg"}]},{"id":1379,"name":"White Italian snail","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Theba pisana","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003EThe shell background color is a creamy white.

The woolly elm aphid overwinters as an egg in bark crevices on elm. In the spring eggs hatch and female aphids emerge. These females feed on foliage, causing the leaves to curl, forming a protective enclosure. The females mature within the leaf curl and give rise to a large second generation of females, most of which develop into winged aphids. These winged aphids migrate from elm to saskatoon in late June until early July. Once a winged female lands on a saskatoon plant, they immediately deposit about 14 female nymphs on the underside of the leaves. These tiny yellow aphid nymphs make their way down the plant to the roots beneath the soil surface. Underground, they will become light-grey to blue, soft-bodied aphids, which will establish a colony that will produce two more generations of females. In August and into September, winged adult females are again produced that migrate back to the elms.

The females of the species use an asexual form of reproduction where the growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male; this type of parthenogenesis, where females are produced from unfertilized eggs, is called thelytoky. It is not known whether the intracellular endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia is responsible for the alteration in reproductive capability. Wolbachia, a genus of inherited bacteria common in insects, are known to alter the sex ratio in arthropods and mites. The sex ratio is also greatly influenced by the host plant: one study found that on citrus, 30% of the population were males, compared to 62% males when reared on grapefruit.
