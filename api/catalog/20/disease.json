Because moisture is essential for infection and blight development, infection sites may be localized in lowlands or under sprinkler irrigation.\u003Cbr \/\u003EUnder cool moist conditions, the patches of diseased plants in the field may rapidly increase in size, and lesions may develop higher in the crop canopy on leaves and pods. Pod infection leads ultimately to seed infection. Such seed contamination is not always visible nor is the fungus in or on the surface of seed easy to detect in the laboratory. Only heavily infected seeds will bear visible blight symptoms, which include small size wrinkles, lesions, and\/or dark discoloration.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"ascochyta-blight-of-chickpeas","images":[{"id":4784,"image":"https:\/\/www.ndsu.edu\/pubweb\/pulse-info\/images\/chickpeapic\/chickpea%20wilt%20-%20seedling%202.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/5\/5d\/5db\/5db15720-940d-45d2-9e4d-197000b3967f.jpg"},{"id":4786,"image":"https:\/\/s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com\/736x\/82\/2c\/a8\/822ca82a5ca714414919e4d82d7c8d6b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/8c\/8c5\/8c561234-95a3-4e3b-a21a-374630e20cea.jpg"},{"id":61198,"image":"https:\/\/s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com\/736x\/73\/93\/81\/73938150813aa75e88a8b9b7db7bc897.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/91\/911\/911c6eba-5a09-4993-8809-ad4a876e4eee.jpg"},{"id":61199,"image":"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/7\/6090\/6056358495_109e80a49f_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/bc\/bcc\/bcc828a8-f491-4dda-be57-c3d64d99ad43.jpg"},{"id":61201,"image":"http:\/\/www.plantmanagementnetwork.org\/pub\/php\/research\/2009\/chickpea\/image\/chickpea1.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/8e\/8eb\/8eb589b0-0ebc-4bc4-a397-2a99e532efa5.jpg"},{"id":72704,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/5377412.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/a\/ad\/adb\/adb8882a-7f87-4127-bbf6-ec4a1fa547fe.jpg"}]},{"id":5089,"name":"Ascochyta blight of Faba Beans","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Ascochyta fabae","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat to look for\u003C\/strong\u003E.

Developing lesions can be confused with symptoms caused by other foliar diseases, such as bacterial pustule, bacterial blight, downy mildew, cercospora leaf blight, frogeye leaf spot and Septoria brown spot. It may also be confused with abiotic factors such as burning herbicide damage. The key diagnostic features of soybean rust are the cone-shaped pustules that form mostly on the undersides of the leaves and the dusty, light-tannish colored spores that erupt from the pustules. Once the disease invades an area, there is only a 7-day period for effective rescue treatment. After one week plants are highly infested and yields are negatively affected. When large necrotic areas are present, it is an indicator that the disease is in an advanced stage and that the fungus is no likely to be controlled by fungicides. Among the most common symptoms are premature defoliation, poor pod filling, and smaller seeds. The premature defoliation and reduction in days to maturity cause plants to have lower seed weight and fewer pods therefore fewer seeds. Due to the leaf perforation of the pustules plants tend to lose a lot of water therefore are commonly moisture stressed. There are two types of reactions, tan and red-brown.

Fruit infections appear as tiny purple to black flecks on the fruit surface of peaches, and as water-soaked spots on nectarines and other smooth skinned Prunus spp. Later, the skin is \u0022broken\u0022 and the flesh beneath the spot becomes sunken. Early season infections result in very deep lesions in the flesh, and infections within 30 days of harvest result in circular, yellowish spots on the fruit surface (photo 2-62). The leaf spots are always angular as a result of being restricted by the veins of the leaf (photo 2-63). Initially, the spots appear as water-soaked angular spots which are generally only visible when viewed with a light source behind the leaf In about three days, the lesion becomes visible with reflected light. Within one to two weeks, the center of the lesion is \u0022walled off\u0022 by the leaf and drops out, resulting in a shothole or tattered appearance.

As of 2004 though, a new classification system was proposed that would change the name of \u003Cem\u003EX. campestris pv vesicatoria\u003C\/em\u003E to \u003Cem\u003EX. euvesicatoria\u003C\/em\u003E (previously group A), and recognized the species \u003Cem\u003EX. vesicatoria\u003C\/em\u003E (group B), \u003Cem\u003EX. perforans\u003C\/em\u003E (group C), and \u003Cem\u003EX. gardneri\u003C\/em\u003E (group D).

Group A contains most of the pepper infecting strains, though some strains from groups B and D have also been reported to cause symptoms on pepper plants.

BLS can also affect the stems of plants, leading to elongated, raised, light-brown cankers, less than .25 inch long.

In cold climates, \u003Cem\u003EXanthamonas campestris pv. Vesicatoria\u003C\/em\u003E infection is mostly caused by contaminated seed material, both on and inside of seeds. If it survives on seeds, it will infect the cotyledons of the growing plant as it emerges from the seed coat. Internally infected seeds will produce diseased plants from the point of germination. Systemic symptoms such as wilting, yellowing, and dwarfing are not typical of plants infected at the point of germination. However, foliage loss can happen when localized symptoms on leaves become severe. If the bacterium survives on debris, it may infect healthy plants through stomata as well as wounds on leaves and fruit. It is spread by direct contact of plants with debris, human movement of the bacteria from debris to plants, and can easily travel from debris to healthy plants through saturated soils via water movement. Once infected, plants begin to develop lesions on the leaves as well as fruit, becoming inoculum sources for further infection.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"bacterial-spot-of-tomatoes","images":[{"id":30682,"image":"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-oQXesaEVaIc\/Tu8UNBVi0lI\/AAAAAAAAA2c\/-vl3d2KrdHQ\/s1600\/Xanthomonas%2Bcampestris%2Bpv%2Bvesicatoria%2B01.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/98\/982\/982e738e-b9c9-4545-b881-bea734cee0cb.jpg"},{"id":30684,"image":"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-xuEHyYgGFpc\/Tu8UW6HMA8I\/AAAAAAAAA20\/MjwVZ-VWAUM\/s1600\/Xanthomonas%2Bcampestris%2Bpv%2Bvesicatoria%2B03.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/90\/907\/907bbef6-4865-44b6-9abe-d3e8b3a4be6b.jpg"},{"id":30687,"image":"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-KbOV66vH33I\/Tu8URpBBezI\/AAAAAAAAA2o\/GisTuDyMFtI\/s1600\/Xanthomonas%2Bcampestris%2Bpv%2Bvesicatoria%2B02.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/0e\/0ec\/0ec9a717-2dcc-4fc5-bd55-dfb54156f9fa.jpg"},{"id":30689,"image":"http:\/\/www.infonet-biovision.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/juicebox_small\/public\/plant_health\/cropsfruitsvegetables\/722_0.jpeg?itok=A36iba2S","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/ed\/ed0\/ed0dff40-c5c5-4122-81ed-fea028f8d1c5.jpg"},{"id":69988,"image":"https:\/\/ediblesanmarcos.files.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/100_1657.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/7\/7d\/7dc\/7dcebf58-b01b-4b2e-b0f0-7d3c22d7692f.jpg"},{"id":69989,"image":"https:\/\/negreenhouseupdate.info\/sites\/negreenhouseupdate.info\/files\/images\/BLSpepper.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/25\/256\/25630ac2-dfc8-4d7b-bf90-2d591ee186fd.jpg"}]},{"id":1499,"name":"Barley leaf rust","nameSynonyms":"Barley brown rust","latinName":"Puccinia simplex","latinNameSynonyms":"Puccinia hordei","description":"\u003Cp align=\u0022justify\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESymptoms\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp align=\u0022justify\u0022\u003ESmall brown, orange pustules may occur on all aerial parts of the plants.

The irregular, black to brown hard masses on the surface of the tuber are sclerotia, or resting bodies, of the fungus. Although these structures adhere tightly to the tuber skin, they are superficial and do not cause damage, even in storage. They do perpetuate the disease and inhibit the establishment of a plant from the tuber if it is used as seed.\u003Cbr \/\u003EBlack scurf is the most noticeable sign of Rhizoctonia. But the most damaging phase of the disease occurs underground and often goes unnoticed. The fungus attacks underground sprouts before they emerge from the soil. Stolons that grow later in the season can also be attacked. The damage varies. The fungal lesion, or canker, can be limited to a superficial brown area that has no discernible effect on plant growth. Severe lesions are large and sunken, as well as necrotic. They interfere with the normal functioning of stems and stolons in translocating starch from leaves to storage in tubers. If the fungal lesion expands quickly, relative to the growth of the plant, the stolon or stem can be girdled and killed.\u003Cbr \/\u003EDamage is most severe at cold temperatures, when emergence and growth of stems and stolons from the tuber are slow relative to the growth of the pathogen. Wet soils also contribute to damage because they warm up more slowly than dry soils and excessive soil moisture slows plant development and favors fungal growth. If Rhizoctonia damage is severe and lesions partially or completely girdle the shoots, sprouts may be stunted or not emerge above the soil. Stolon cankers reduce tuber numbers and size and are identical to shoot cankers in appearance.\u003Cbr \/\u003EPoor stands may be mistaken for seed tuber decay, caused by Fusarium species or soft rot bacteria, unless the plants are excavated and examined. Rhizoctonia does not cause seed decay; its damage is limited to sprouts and stolons. Poor stands and stunted plants can also be caused by blackleg, a bacterial disease that initiates from the seed tuber and progresses up the stems, causing a wet, sometimes slimy, rot. In contrast, Rhizoctonia lesions are always dry and usually sunken.\u003Cbr \/\u003ELate season damage to plants is a direct result of cankers on stolons and stems causing problems with starch translocation. Tubers forming on diseased stolons may be deformed. If stolons and underground stems are severely infected with Rhizoctonia canker, they cannot carry the starch produced in the leaves to the developing tubers. In this case, small, green tubers, called aerial tubers, may form on the stem above the soil. Formation of aerial tubers may indicate that the plant has no tubers of marketable quality below ground.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAt the end of the growing season, the fungus produces its sexual state, \u003Cem\u003EThanetephorus cucumeris, \u003C\/em\u003Eon stems just above the soil line.

Downy mold carries thousands of small reproductive units called conidia. If conidia forms at different spots in the seedbed an outbreak is more than likely to occur.

As the cane grows, the spots increase in size, become elliptical with their major axis parallel to the main axis of the cane, and several spots may begin to coalesce. The centre of the spot becomes silvery white, though the margin remains purple and becomes slightly raised by mid-summer. After this stage the whitish centres slowly become sunken below the surface of the cane until they form elliptical pits with narrow purple margins in September. The deep pits frequently expose the phloem fibres under the deep-seated periderm (polyderm), and deep cracks parallel to the main axis of the cane may then expose other internal vascular tissues as canes become dormant in late autumn. Late summer infections lead to the development of small (1 mm diam.) superficial lesions from which sunken pits do not arise. In autumn, as the young cane turns brown, the spots become greyish-white and develop minute black dots (conidiomata), sometimes arranged in concentric circular patterns - a symptom described as the \u0027grey bark phase\u0027.

In serious attacks, the leaf laminae may be covered in minute spot-lesions which often coalesce and the leaf may curl downwards or be shed prematurely. The petioles when attacked show elliptical lesions with whitish centres, similar to those forming on stems. In blackberry and blackberry x red raspberry hybrids, such as loganberry, tayberry and tummelberry, the lesions on leaf laminae are extremely conspicuous on the adaxial surface because they develop a broad reddish-purple margin and a greyish-white centre, and often coalesce to affect whole leaflets.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn fruiting stems (floricanes, or second-year canes).\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/strong\u003EThe epidermis of raspberry canes turn brown in autumn as the deep-seated stem periderm polyderm matures and the primary cortex and epidermis die. Consequently, over-wintered canes affected by cane spot do not show the purple margin around the pits, but the pits continue to deepen and the damage to vascular tissues becomes more evident in late winter and early spring as deep splits develop in areas and the phloem fibres (bast) are exposed. Secondary growth around the lesions leads to canker formation and distortion of the cane. Early infections in the previous year often lead to deep pits, girdling of the vascular cylinder and death of the stem above this point. Consequently, when the stems renew growth in spring, the lateral shoots may fail to develop, or wilt and desiccate soon after emergence. In heavily infected plantations in early spring, when conditions are moist and conducive for spore dissemination, it is possible for the laminae of emerging leaves on fruiting raspberry canes to be destroyed and no fruit produced. In blackberries, the primary cortex does not die at the end of the first summer because the periderm retains passage cells providing a connection to the internal vascular tissues. The purple margin around stem lesions may persist until the following spring.

Paraphyses are threadlike, colorless, expanded at ends, to 75 microns long. Ascospores are oviform or elliptical, straight or weakly bent and colorless, unicellular, 10 x 5 microns. Large amounts of spores drift into the air during cool to warm wet weather, being carried by wind flow and rain splash to other plants. Thus, the disease can spread quickly throughout a field.

Young, rapidly growing elms may die in one to two months; older or less vigorous trees sometimes take two years or more to succumb. A brown to black discoloration occurs in the white sapwood of wilting branches just under the bark. Because symptoms are easily confused with other diseases, especially elm phloem\u0026nbsp;necrosis and diebacks, positive diagnosis is only possible through laboratory culturing. The fungus can spread up to 50 feet (15 metres) from diseased to healthy trees by natural root grafts.

The diagnostic pinkish-red mold originates at the tip of an ear and grows toward the base. It usually does not infect an entire ear. The husk of a diseased ear may stick to the kernels and be difficult to remove (Wise et al. n.d.). Sometimes the mycelium is pale pink, which can lead to this ear rot\u0026rsquo;s being confused with similar diseases, such as those caused by Diplodia and its grayish-colored mycelium (\u0026ldquo;Corn Insect and Disease Guide: Gibberella Ear Rot\u0026rdquo; 2014, VanDyk 2002). Gibberella species causing ear rots on corn will also produce small, dark perithecia on the kernels, stalk, or husk. Fusarium ear rot produces white, pale pink, or pale lavender mycelia. Unlike Gibberella, Fusarium does not produce perithecia. Fusarium ear rot is often associated with insect infestations such as thrips or corn earworms. It tends not to engulf an entire ear but to remain localized around insect feeding injuries. A visual diagnosis of these diseases using their symptoms and signs is easy to perform and without cost; therefore, serological or molecular detection methods for diagnosis, such Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), are seldom necessary.

Secondary and tertiary leaf veins limit the width of the lesion and sometimes individual lesions can combine to blight entire leaves.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDisease Cycle\u003C\/strong\u003E. \u003Cem\u003ECercospora zeae-maydis\u003C\/em\u003E survives only as long as infected corn debris is present; however, it is a poor soil competitor. The debris on the soil surface is a cause for primary inoculation that infects the incoming corn crop for the next season. By late spring, conidia (asexual spores) are produced by \u003Cem\u003ECercospora zeae-maydis\u003C\/em\u003E in the debris through wind dispersal or rain. The conidia are disseminated and eventually infect new corn crop. In order for the pathogen to actually infect the host, high relative humidity and moisture (dew) on the leaves are necessary for inoculation. Primary inoculation occurs on lower regions of younger leaves, where conidia germinate across leaf surfaces and penetrate through stomata via a flattened hyphal organ, an appressorium. \u003Cem\u003ECercospora zeae-maydis\u003C\/em\u003E is atypical in that its conidia can grow and survive for days before penetration, unlike most spores that need to penetrate within hours to ensure survival. Once infection occurs, the conidia are produced in these lower leaf regions. Assuming favorable weather conditions (see Environment Section), these conidia serve as secondary inoculum for upper leaf regions, as well as husks and sheaths (where it can also overwinter and produce conidia the following season). Additionally, wind and heavy rains tend to disperse the conidia during many secondary cycles to other parts of the field causing more secondary cycles of infection. If conditions are unfavorable for inoculation, the pathogen undergoes a state of dormancy during the winter season and reactivates when conditions favorable to inoculation return (moist, humid) the following season. The fungus overwinters as stromata (mixture of plant tissues and fungal mycelium) in leaf debris, which give rise to conidia causing primary inoculations the following spring and summer.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"gray-leaf-spot-1","images":[{"id":59454,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/1524200.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/1\/1c\/1c1\/1c1cfc95-46d9-4111-bd03-0911f2147be5.jpg"},{"id":59455,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/1524196.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/3b\/3b7\/3b7baee2-9096-4ce9-878b-8124a084ef86.jpg"},{"id":59456,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/5465609.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/fc\/fcf\/fcf8d184-ffce-402d-83d1-1565728a1a6b.jpg"},{"id":59457,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/5465613.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/93\/931\/93117c24-24de-4410-83a3-4d60c4f6bf41.jpg"},{"id":59458,"image":"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/2\/1719\/23895549543_6be665c287_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/0e\/0e6\/0e6f5f59-e53f-47a5-9ace-e036a92c65ba.jpg"}]},{"id":5775,"name":"Gray snow mold","nameSynonyms":"Typhula blight","latinName":"Typhula incarnata","latinNameSynonyms":"Typhula ishikariensis","description":"\u003Cp\u003EAfter the snow melts in the spring, symptoms can be observed as circular straw-colored or grayish brown infection centers in the turf.

In the spring, apothecia develop on these leaves. Ascospores are produced in these fungal fruiting bodies and are forcibly ejected during rainy periods for about 6\u0026ndash;8 weeks, starting at petal fall. This is the telemorph or sexual stage and results in new genetic recombination and variation for the disease. This pathogen mainly affects and is most noticeable on the leaves of cherry trees. The most obvious symptom of this disease is the yellowing of leaves before they drop in the early spring. Infected leaves are filled with numerous black lesions that cover an obvious portion of the leaf. These lesions first appear as small purple spots which turn red to brown and then black. Most spots are circular but can amalgamate to form large, irregular dead patches. These spots tend to enlarge and separate from healthy tissue. Lastly, they drop out of the leaf giving a \u0026ldquo;shot-hole\u0026rdquo; appearance. This shot hole effect is more common on sour than on sweet cherries. In more severe and advanced cases, lesions are found on the fruit, petioles, and stems. Leaves with lesions present typically fall off early in the growing season and it is common for seriously affected trees to be defoliated by midsummer. Leaves severely infected by the disease turn very yellow before falling off.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the disease is not controlled and allowed to persist for several years there could be various adverse effects to the overall cherry production of a tree primarily due to the cycle of early season and repeated defoliation.

Spores are dispersed within a few days and a naked, blackish and erect rachis remains visible above the healthy crop at maturity.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECause\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe fungus is strictly seed-borne and enters the field within the embryos of seed in which it was established earlier by infecting the seed crop during anthesis.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"loose-smut-of-wheat-5","images":[{"id":10386,"image":"http:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/1234001.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/20\/20c\/20c00490-d94b-47ef-9f77-a0f9e53d4000.jpg"},{"id":10388,"image":"http:\/\/web2.mendelu.cz\/af_291_projekty2\/vseo\/files\/93\/8820.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/6\/65\/656\/6568eea3-9a5d-4ccf-bcb5-10f02eb24f40.jpg"},{"id":10392,"image":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b8\/Charbon_nu.jpg\/440px-Charbon_nu.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/3d\/3d3\/3d309dd5-1c46-4c84-b5ff-a5933a8352f0.jpg"},{"id":55000,"image":"https:\/\/farm9.static.flickr.com\/8622\/16316807437_7bfca5d023_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/49\/49a\/49a1df1a-54fd-4e60-a591-3a4195a2cb0f.jpg"},{"id":55001,"image":"http:\/\/web2.mendelu.cz\/af_291_projekty2\/vseo\/files\/93\/8128.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/d\/d4\/d4a\/d4a58759-d236-4471-93e7-ab8647d7d504.jpg"}]},{"id":1644,"name":"Melanose","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Diaporthe citri","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003ELeaf - about one week after infection foliar symptoms appear as small brown discrete spots.

Northern leaf blight of maize and sorghum forms larger and fewer lesions than Cochliobolus heterostrophus, mostly on the leaves but also on the stalks of sorghum.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"northern-corn-leaf-blight-1","images":[{"id":71614,"image":"https:\/\/www.ars.usda.gov\/images\/docs\/10482_10676\/NLB2.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/d\/d7\/d76\/d764d5bc-3ecd-4a70-ad0b-ae9506d33eec.jpg"},{"id":71615,"image":"https:\/\/www7.inra.fr\/hyp3\/images\/6033012.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/c4\/c42\/c42cb6ef-10ce-4273-a8cb-e6a8b88b2e6c.jpg"},{"id":71617,"image":"http:\/\/www.pestnet.org\/fact_sheets\/assets\/image\/maize_northern_leaf_blight_226\/setomaize1.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/d\/d2\/d25\/d2592297-27e2-4007-a467-f001727f3825.jpg"},{"id":71618,"image":"http:\/\/www.pestnet.org\/fact_sheets\/assets\/image\/maize_northern_leaf_blight_226\/setomaize2.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/91\/916\/916223a4-115d-40a5-a1f3-459353dad7b4.jpg"},{"id":71620,"image":"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4136\/4886729066_b983fd3347_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/45\/450\/450b9f97-422f-4df2-818f-7fb145187bec.jpg"},{"id":71623,"image":"https:\/\/www7.inra.fr\/hyp3\/images\/6033016.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/88\/887\/887df16e-9b0e-47e2-b570-fa83e6204553.jpg"}]},{"id":5270,"name":"Northern corn leaf spot","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Helminthosporium carbonum","latinNameSynonyms":"Cochliobolus carbonum","description":"\u003Cp align=\u0022left\u0022\u003ENorthern corn leaf spot (NCLS) is primarily a concern in seed production fields where susceptible inbreds are planted. Hybrids may show some minor flecking or small lesions, but most hybrids carry adequate resistance to prevent economic losses from occurring. NCLS is favored by many of the same conditions as for NCLB and SCLB. It is primarily limited to northern Illinois, but may be found in seed fields in north central Illinois when moderate temperatures and high moisture levels occur. Spores are produced abundantly in damp weather.\u003Cbr \/\u003ELesions of NCLS can vary depending on the race present. Race 1 lesions are tan, oval to circular with concentric zones and are commonly 1\/2 inch in width and 1 inch in length. Race 2 infections are rare. Lesions are oblong, dark brown to blackish in color and 1\/8 inch in width and 1 inch in length. Race 3 lesions are most common in the Corn Belt. These lesions are narrow and linear in shape, with lengths less than 1 inch and widths less than 1\/8 inch. Lesion shape and size may vary with the genotype of the plant. Lesions are grayish-tan and surrounded by a pigmented border. Control measures are not usually necessary for commercial hybrids. Seed production fields can benefit from fungicide applications, especially for highly susceptible inbreds.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThere are at least three known races of NCLS. Race 1 is highly pathogenic on some inbred lines; Race 2 is much less pathogenic; Race 3 is primarily a problem in seed production fields. It can also produce lesions on commercial hybrids but does no economic damage. There is also evidence that a fourth race may occur or it may be a biotype of one of the other races.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"northern-corn-leaf-spot-1","images":[{"id":13014,"image":"http:\/\/www.melkvee.nl\/upload\/nieuws\/lightbox\/1469ea149.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/34\/34c\/34cab91f-b851-4347-ac6c-53c4b6ffe6be.jpg"},{"id":13016,"image":"http:\/\/panorama-agro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Helminthosporium-carbonum.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/c8\/c80\/c806343f-b97d-434d-97e7-fc5dc5437e5e.jpg"},{"id":71579,"image":"http:\/\/green-24.de\/forum\/weblogs\/upload\/1\/229919515478ef43853f01.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/35\/352\/3528fa3c-5c59-42be-a0e2-496ce5e8c01f.jpg"},{"id":71580,"image":"http:\/\/www.pflanzenkrankheiten.ch\/images\/Getreide_Mais\/Exserohilum_turcicum\/symptome\/becssg_images\/f_turcicum_flecken_4_523_348_95.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/41\/410\/4103e6a0-3827-4f88-88cf-48bf50fa7a18.jpg"},{"id":71581,"image":"http:\/\/www.naro.affrc.go.jp\/org\/nilgs\/diseases\/contents\/IMG\/img0009.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/7\/70\/70a\/70ac1f76-428a-470a-afed-18297d6ff06a.jpg"}]},{"id":5083,"name":"Northern leaf blight","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Setosphaeria turcica","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESetosphaeria turcica\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/strong\u003E (anamorph \u003Cem\u003EExserohilum turcicum\u003C\/em\u003E; formerly known as \u003Cem\u003EHelminthosporium turcicum\u003C\/em\u003E) is the causal agent of northern corn leaf blight in maize.

Juniper is the winter host and pear is the most common summer host. Spores (called aeciospores) are produced from the fungal lantern-shaped growths which protrude from the blisters on the underside of the pear leaf which become airborne and infect junipers. This fungus overwinters in swellings or galls on infected twigs and branches of susceptible juniper plants. In the spring after a rain or heavy dew, the galls on the juniper produce tiny dark horn-like growths that become covered with an orange-brown gelatinous mass called telia. The corresponding stage on the pear trees is known as aecia. The telia and aecia release wind borne resting or hibernating spores (called teliospores and aeciospores) capable of infecting susceptible pear leaves and Juniper respectively. Spores produced from the fungus-induced swellings on juniper stems can be infectious up to 6\u0026nbsp;km. The disease causes a yellow-orange spot that turns bright red on leaves of pear trees. The disease can be particularly damaging on pear, resulting in complete defoliation and crop loss if not treated. The fungus feeds on the living cells of the host plant and is not capable of surviving on dead plant material, and so must either alternate with a different host or produce resting spores to pass the dormant season. Pear rust is a regulated disease in some countries.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"pear-trellis-rust","images":[{"id":28677,"image":"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/static\/uploads\/photo\/2012\/10\/06\/02\/22\/gymnosporangium-fuscum-59906_960_720.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/8b\/8b6\/8b6a7d84-a917-48cc-b18b-7bd056d9a998.jpg"},{"id":28680,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/ef\/Birnengitterrost_Gymnosporangium_fuscum_3088.jpg\/1024px-Birnengitterrost_Gymnosporangium_fuscum_3088.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/d\/db\/db1\/db13a35b-259a-439d-b81c-35c2fc1378f9.jpg"},{"id":56069,"image":"http:\/\/jule.pflanzenbestimmung.de\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Gymnosporangium-sabinae_Pyrus-communis_JKruse-2.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/20\/201\/2010236c-e11b-4cd8-acd6-c0ec8f965811.jpg"},{"id":56070,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Birnengitterrost_Gymnosporangium_fuscum_3090.jpg\/1024px-Birnengitterrost_Gymnosporangium_fuscum_3090.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/30\/304\/3040b590-2682-46ae-9b33-3b90cb73299c.jpg"},{"id":61192,"image":"http:\/\/cdn.c.photoshelter.com\/img-get\/I0000TajKxcaKNgs\/s\/600\/600\/3045791.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/4d\/4d4\/4d488e27-1088-432a-9b65-5f041b6b9053.jpg"}]},{"id":11868,"name":"Pearl millet rust","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Puccinia substriata","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe life-cycle of this rust variety remains somewhat obscure and the connection between the telial stage on pearl millet and the aecial stage on Solanaceae has never been experimentally demonstrated.

Phytophthora infections typically kill young trees because their root systems and crown areas are small compared to those of mature trees.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"phytophthora-root-and-crown-rot","images":[{"id":14742,"image":"http:\/\/www.omafra.gov.on.ca\/IPM\/images\/apples\/diseases\/apples_phytophthora_04_zoom.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/24\/240\/2401e88e-e45d-479b-979e-1d39894177e5.jpg"},{"id":14743,"image":"http:\/\/www.idtools.org\/id\/citrus\/diseases\/images\/fs_images\/06Phytophthora.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/00\/00f\/00fc21b3-c02d-4edb-b0f2-036e031cf0d3.jpg"},{"id":14744,"image":"http:\/\/aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu\/citrus\/images\/footrot.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/85\/857\/857d7a99-7929-45bf-af52-6ce8e94ab112.jpg"},{"id":14745,"image":"http:\/\/www.omafra.gov.on.ca\/IPM\/images\/tender\/diseases-and-disorders\/phytophthora\/phytophthora6a_zoom.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/99\/994\/99492aaa-46cc-46ce-9cf6-9c2c970ab3e9.jpg"},{"id":14747,"image":"http:\/\/www.omafra.gov.on.ca\/IPM\/images\/apples\/diseases\/apples_phytophthora_01_zoom.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/9\/9d\/9d7\/9d73544e-1bdb-45b4-a50b-f6f6c9aed5c9.jpg"}]},{"id":2522,"name":"Phytophthora root rot of Cranberries","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Vaccinium macrocarpon","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp\u003EDead spots in the bed occur first in poorly drained areas.

Special resting spore are produced, allowing overwinter survival of the species that causes the disease in cucurbits, lettuce, peas, and certain other crops.\u003Cbr \/\u003EMost powdery mildew fungi grow as thin layers of mycelium (fungal tissue) on the surface of the affected plant part. Spores,\u0026nbsp;which are the primary means of dispersal, make up the bulk of the white, powdery growth visible on the plant\u0026rsquo;s surface and are produced in chains that can be seen with a hand lens; in contrast, spores of downy mildew grow on branched stalks that look like tiny trees.\u003Cbr \/\u003EPowdery mildew spores are carried by wind to new hosts. Although humidity requirements for germination vary, all powdery mildew species can germinate and infect in the absence of free water. In fact, spores of some powdery mildew fungi are killed and germination is inhibited by water on plant surfaces for extended periods. Moderate temperatures (60\u0026deg; to 80\u0026deg;F) and shady conditions generally are the most favorable for powdery mildew development.

A gray-white, dusty, fungal growth consisting of mycelia, conidia and conidiophores coat much of the infected plant.

This offspring, a young clesitothecium, is used to infect the host immediately or overwinter on the host to infect when the timing is right (typically in spring). To infect, it produces a conidiophore that then bears conidia. These conidium move along to a susceptible surface to germinate. Once these spores or conidia germinate, they produce a structure called a haustoria, capable of \u0022sucking\u0022 nutrients from the plant cells directly under the epidermis of the leaf. At this point, the fungi can infect leaves, buds and twigs that then reinfect other plants or further infect the current host.

This ascomycete is only pathogenic on hop plants, including both ornamental and wild hops. The host range of many \u003Cem\u003EPodosphaera macularis\u003C\/em\u003E strains is restricted by the existence of resistant hop varieties, such as the \u0026ldquo;Nugget\u0026rdquo; variety of Washington state and Oregon, although in recent years, resistance within this hop variety has been overcome in the laboratory. When disease does occur, early symptoms include chlorotic spots on the leaves of hop plants. Spots may fade to gray or white as the season progresses. Signs include white clusters of hyphae, which are often present on the leaves, and in some cases can infect the cone itself. If this infection occurs, a brown, necrotic lesion may develop.

These chasmothecia are formed closer to the end of the growing season. The characteristic morphology of chasmothecia of Hop Powdery Mildew are spherical black structures with spiked appendages. When favorable conditions are encountered during early spring, the asci (sac-like structures) within chasmothecia will rupture and ascospores will be discharged. Specifically, the favorable conditions for ascospore release include low light, excess fertility, and high soil moisture. Additionally, optimal infection is observed when the temperature is between 18 and 25\u0026nbsp;\u0026deg;C. Furthermore, the ascospores act as the primary inoculum and are dispersed passively by wind. Upon encountering a susceptible host plant, the ascospores will germinate and cause infection. Following infection, masses of asexual spores (conidia) will be produced during the season. It is these masses of conidia that contribute to the characteristic white, powdery appearance of infected plants. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the disease can appear on any part of the plant that is above the ground. These conidia are dispersed through wind. Thus, \u003Cem\u003EPodosphaera macularis\u003C\/em\u003E is a polycyclic pathogen as conidia are produced\/dispersed during the growing season and can further infect additional host plants. Particularly, the disease will be noticeable on infected plants as soon as the hop shoots start to emerge with the latent period being approximately 10 days at 12 and 15\u0026deg;C compared to 5 days at 18-27\u0026deg;C. These spore-covered shoots that emerge from infected buds are called \u0026ldquo;flag shoots\u0026rdquo; and will be stunted with distorted leaves. Periods of rapid plant growth are the most favorable for infection. In addition, the period in which lateral branch development takes place within the plants is also very vulnerable to the development of the disease.

While \u003Cem\u003EL. taurica\u003C\/em\u003E can infect many different plants it is actually very host specific. Different races of \u003Cem\u003EL. taurica\u003C\/em\u003E can only infect certain crops, and even specific cultivars within the same crop. An accurate way to describe its host specificity is that this disease is, \u0026ldquo;a composite species consisting of many host-specific races.\u0022 Symptoms of Onion Powdery Mildew (OPM) are usually seen as circular or oblong lesions that are 5 to 20\u0026nbsp;mm and have a chlorotic or necrotic appearance. The lesions appear on older leaves before the bulb of the onion begins to form, but also can occur on the younger leaves towards the end of the season. As the disease progresses signs of OPM can also be seen. On the lesions white mycelium can be found with conidiophores bearing either lanceolate or rounded condia.\u003Cbr \/\u003EDisease Cycle. The polycyclic disease cycle of \u003Cem\u003EL. taurica\u003C\/em\u003E is similar to that of other powdery mildew species. It overwinters (as chasmothecia) in crop residues above the soil surface. Under favorable climatic conditions, the chasmothecia open and release ascospores, which are wind-dispersed. The ascospores enter the host through its stomata, germinate, and colonize the host\u0026rsquo;s tissues with its mycelia. The pathogen then begins to produce its asexual conidia, either singly or on branched conidiophores. The conidia exit through the host\u0026rsquo;s stomata and serve as a secondary inoculum to spread disease after initial infection. In the fall, the pathogen undergoes sexual reproduction and again produces chasmothecia, its dormant, overwintering structure.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"powdery-mildew-of-onions-1","images":[{"id":54806,"image":"http:\/\/www.apsnet.org\/publications\/imageresources\/PublishingImages\/2010\/IW000119.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/bc\/bc9\/bc9c7f2f-bda7-4640-b125-fb13abcabbf0.jpg"},{"id":65029,"image":"http:\/\/zipcodezoo.com\/images\/thumb\/0\/06\/Leveillula_taurica_0.jpg\/300px-Leveillula_taurica_0.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/bd\/bd0\/bd03e4cf-d867-4568-a35c-212264fe1415.jpg"},{"id":65031,"image":"http:\/\/cdn.c.photoshelter.com\/img-get\/I0000TZTYsNnUR80\/s\/600\/600\/512559.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/c\/c1\/c1e\/c1eb20ed-0a39-442a-aa46-79e9cc85b5fa.jpg"},{"id":65032,"image":"http:\/\/www.plantmanagementnetwork.org\/pub\/php\/brief\/2010\/pepper\/image\/pepper2.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/3\/3a\/3ad\/3ad322ef-83e2-4dd3-998b-1b40f23d8de2.jpg"},{"id":72719,"image":"http:\/\/www.agrobestgrup.com\/images\/icerik\/Oidiopsis_PwderyMildew3.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/2\/2c\/2c9\/2c98e67b-089f-40ae-bdfd-92026d1b7d3c.jpg"}]},{"id":1664,"name":"Powdery mildew of Papaya","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Oidium indicum","latinNameSynonyms":"Oidium caricae, Leveillula taurica","description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan id=\u0022yui_3_13_0_2_1453385093038_452\u0022\u003EThe disease appears on the foliage and pods.

Usually, red stele is first noticed during bloom of the second year. The symptoms will be most noticeable in low or soil compacted areas of a field where water drainage is poor. Strawberry plants infected with P. fragariae will show a general lack of vigor with poor runner growth and small berries. New leaves may appear bluish-green, while older leaves sometimes turn red, orange or yellow. The leaves tend to wilt during warm weather or drought stress.

Examine roots of plants which are just beginning to show signs of wilting. If red stele is present, the roots will appear unbranched and will be lacking feeder roots.

Select a white root with a rotted tip and make a lengthwise cut at the point where diseased root tissue meets healthy tissue. Red stele infected roots will have a reddish-brown core, but the outer tissue will be white. The discoloration will begin at the root tip and move upwards, but usually will not move into the crowd.

Hosta plants may or may not completely die as a result of infection. On mature pepper and tomato, the stem cortex several centimeters (inches) above and below the soil surface will decay, but the stem central cylinder does not decay. As the lower stem decay develops, plants usually remain erect and foliage wilts. On many host plants, wilted leaves gradually become brown and remain hanging on the plant.\u003Cbr \/\u003EOn peanut, one or more branches may wilt and leaves on these branches appear slightly faded and then turn brown. A few branches often survive on each plant. Peanuts infected in dry weather will have 2.0 - 2.5 cm (~1 in.) cankers located 2 - 3 cm (1-2 in.) below the soil line. Only one canker is usually seen per plant. When stems are partly girdled, leaves are often small with a mild brown coloration, but wilt does not occur. When peanuts are infected in wet, hot weather, stems become totally rotted except for the xylem.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs lower stems of herbaceous plants decay, a white mat of mycelium develops at the lesion site. This white mat will often spread out onto the nearby soil surface. Shortly after the mycelial mat develops, small (0.5-1 mm), white, round, fuzzy mycelial bodies begin to appear. These mustard-seed-sized structures, called sclerotia, soon become smooth and light tan, brown or black in color. Sclerotia serve as overwintering bodies and may be seen in the mycelium, on diseased tissues above or below ground, on soil surfaces, or in soil crevices.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESclerotium rolfsii\u003C\/em\u003E\u0026nbsp;infections of woody plants usually begin as a crown rot. Characteristic white mycelial mats and sclerotia also develop at the crown infection sites when conditions are favorable. Foliage wilting and dieback develop as a consequence of the rotting of the lower trunk or crown tissues.\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhen monocots such as wheat and some other grasses are infected, symptoms and signs of the disease are different from those described above for dicots. Brown lesions occur at the crown and lower parts of the culm. Lesions are often small, but they may extend into the hollow part of the culm. Strands of mycelium grow inside the lower internodes. Seedheads may appear normal, but they are devoid of grain. Premature ripening also may occur. On millet, grain sorghum, and tall fescue, the leaf sheath becomes water-soaked, and the brown discoloration turns to dark brown or black. Mats of white mycelium develop and spread upward inside and outside the leaf sheaths. The mycelium eventually spreads over the base of grass blades where sclerotia develop. Southern blight is not common on wheat and small grains, but it does occur on cool season turf species such as bentgrass, fescue, perennial ryegrass, bluegrass, and broad leaf turf species such as\u003Cem\u003EDichondra\u003C\/em\u003E\u0026nbsp;spp. when conditions are warm (above 24 C \/ 75 F) and moisture is abundant.\u003C\/p\u003E","slug":"southern-stem-rot","images":[{"id":19285,"image":"http:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/1235117.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/4\/4d\/4dc\/4dc5c2d9-6df9-4442-beed-93da6b7bcb01.jpg"},{"id":68984,"image":"http:\/\/www.buncombemastergardener.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SouthernStemBlight_Close-up_PepperPlant_NC-State-Extension-1.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/b\/be\/be5\/be53d250-891f-4e99-9658-ad178a5c420b.jpg"},{"id":68985,"image":"http:\/\/mushroomobserver.org\/images\/320\/214149.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/f\/f5\/f58\/f58ec09b-876c-4959-9eb5-093ae11a69de.jpg"},{"id":68987,"image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d3\/Sclerotium_delphinii_on_Hosta.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/e\/e3\/e32\/e32fef2c-dcaa-4e68-ae50-b084c332ff67.jpg"},{"id":68989,"image":"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/8\/7686\/16963462519_8b38988be1_b.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/0\/02\/029\/029b3e6c-6527-47aa-9b8a-98cb61e238e6.jpg"},{"id":68991,"image":"https:\/\/bugwoodcloud.org\/images\/768x512\/5077063.jpg","thumb":"http:\/\/static.catalog.farmis.lt\/problems\/8\/83\/833\/833ec7f0-6fd1-4539-b72c-d7f1864d08c9.jpg"}]},{"id":1518,"name":"Spot blotch","nameSynonyms":"","latinName":"Bipolaris sorokiniana, Cochliobolus sativus","latinNameSynonyms":"","description":"\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: justify;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EC. sativus is an ascomycetous fungus (order Pleosporales), however, the teleomorph is not involved in disease epidemiology.

Several formae speciales of P. striiformis West. var. striiformis have been successively named on the basis of physiological specialization: P. striiformis f.sp. tritici collected from wheat.

They appear about 1 week after infection, and sporulation starts about 2 weeks after infection, under optimum temperature conditions. The pustules, which are tiny, yellow- to orange-colored, are often arranged into conspicuous stripes. Lines of bright yellow new urediospores give the typical striped appearance on the leaves from which the specific name striiformis and common name stripe rust are derived. In Europe the yellow color of the spores caused it to be given the common name yellow rust. During the summer, stripe rust infection of wheat spikes may occur, resulting in the formation of masses of spores between the glume and the lemma.

P. striiformis hyphae are thread-like and spread between intercellular spaces of their host. Hyphae are dikaryotic and often multinucleate. Once inside the leaf, haustoria are inserted into the mesophyll cells and the mycelium spreads along the leaf. In mature leaves it spreads longitudinally between the veins of the leaf. Two kinds of spores are produced by P. striiformis: urediniospores and teliospores. Urediniospores are 20-30 \u0026micro;m in diameter, yellow-orange and spherical. They have thick, spiny walls and 6-12 scattered germ pores. Teliospores are two-celled, ellipsoid to clavate, orange to brown, and 12-20 x 36-68 \u0026micro;m. The teliospores are flattened at their apex and have smooth, thick walls with a slight constriction at the septum.
